Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible friday by the love of your life. Now you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. If you read this and ignore it you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works.
love this one

Still Amazing
Cold Water Pt. 2?
DID U GET MY COMMENTS!?1.WHY add Nicky to the song?U could of add another girl or wizkid.Add someone else other than her!2.If Nicky could take out some stuff that does not make sense.Not all but some of the stuff.With respect from ur biggest fan😐
WHY ADD NICKY TO THE SONG.CHECK MY COMMENT ON YOUTUBE ABOUT THE SONG.Why? He could of add Wizkid or someone else!?Why her?Majorlazer im ur biggest fan and being honest.The song is good but Nicky should adjust something from the song.If she takes out something I the people in the comments will be satisfied 
Please make a version without Nicky
:/
