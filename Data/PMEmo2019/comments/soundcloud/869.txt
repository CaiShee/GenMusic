Dope!
Amazing! :D
Best remix of All We Know. Really.
"Can't forget you" - San Holo melody rip off???
this right here!!!!!!
the best
Sick!
awesome!!!!! <3
Another one!
oh, so good!!
damn the drop
love it
uh......... san holo, ok.
Beautiful Song !!!
damn nice
Amazing work!
To everyone saying it sounds like cant forget you: Only a small part of the melody does, the chords and legit everything else is not even close. Stop being so dumb. Great work Paris & Nolan.
nice remix
is this san holo? Oh wait.
@sanholo
ripoff of san holos cant forget you
yooooo!!!!
Dope remix!
@josh-staten-2: truu, and parts of the production (bassline especially i feel) is improved
fucking awesome 
awesome
@pepethefrog: Not lashing out, brah. Just making a simple observation that the drop sounds the same. Other people are clearly noticing the same thing as well. I'm happy for you that you like the song, but my opinion differs. I never, ever complain about music because it's subjective. I just don't like it when songs sound like a rip off of another song. That's all.
Dreamy <3
https://soundcloud.com/gian-dluck/gian-dluck-black-moon-original-mix please listen
He killed it one more time !
OMFG beautiful *___*
@spexedm: And yes i know they sound exactly the same, but it's not 100% the same at all
@spexedm: U know, being mean will never get you better with music production. Help and support will help you and the people u support growing bigger
What a BOMB !
@briley-alexander: But people like yourself ALWAYS have to complain about little things because you have a depressingly sad life of your own. (:
@briley-alexander: No, i'm not insane, i'm just smart enough to hear that only the top line melody of the drop is SLIGHTLY similar.  The chords/structure and fuck all else is different.. way different.  it's not a copy, its a coincidence.  Think before you lash out for no fuckin reason
@pepethefrog: It's not because you've never heard of somebody called Briley that you have to laugh with them.
RIP San Holo, this is better. But San Holo's music is good too.
soundcloud and chill
Paris Bloh & Nolan van Lith again :D
@spexedm: boy have u ever heard of inspiration? I don't think u could make something better
@spexedm: U dumb fuck
@spexedm: also agree.
@pepethefrog: Are you insane? It's almost identical... I can also scroll up and down this page and see 5 other comments saying the same thing. Btw, who the fuck taught you grammar? Get out of here Helen Keller.
@pepethefrog: Are you insane? The drop is almost identical... I can also scroll up and down on this page and see 5 other comments saying the exact same thing. Btw, who the fuck taught you grammar?
you guys always kill it together and individually
SO GOOODDD!!
Can't Forget You - San Holo?? :D
WOWWWOW ❤
Love
@briley-alexander: This remix doesn't sound like that song even the slightest to complain about.  Btw, who the fuck named you Briley? hahaha
the drop sounds like marshmello vibes :)but i love this remix <3
Did San Holo write this for you? Or did you just copy paste can't forget you?
;)
cant forget you
Some parts sound like closer
Yes!
5,000 plays r me. this songs bumps
@spexedm: agree
flames
OMG!!
so good! <3 you never disappoint me Paris!
ripped off San Holo - Can't Forget You.
Another round of a Chainsmoker song remixed taking over soundcloud...
Not really into this genre but Paris always smashes it.
damn, now paris blohm has become mainstream'
snooze
dopee
nice work Paris! like the new style
i fucking love each of your amazing tracks
@octave-6: I agree with this. Although this version has some cool moments as well!
