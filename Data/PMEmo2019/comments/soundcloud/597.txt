R.I.P, Chester <3 you were my inspiration from a young age, and to many of your fans who, like me, have watched Linkin Park evolve over time. You touched so many people's lives,  putting your heart and soul into your music, You gave the world a piece of yourself that will continue to live on.

Best song ever

Such a great song!
u suck
@user-457620793: i agree
👍❤️
yea love this song
Why is this so perfect ; - ;
linkin park thank you
this is my fav ever
so true
interesting song?
This song is really good in my opinion. A lot of people strongly dislike the song because of the type of genre Linkin Park is doing with this song. But hopefully, the album is a hard rock album like they did with Hybrid Theory and Meteora. If the album is electronic like A Thousand Suns, then I will not be happy with the album. But this song is really good and emotional. The vocals in this song is really good and I hope One More Light will be a very good Linkin Park album.
i love this song so much
This is alot more different than his older stuff but its still rather good
cool bro
i love this sone soo much, thank god LINKIN PARK is still around! i still like there old stuff more though.
love it
Amazing ✨
Great song
Love this ✨🔥💓💗❤️

A year ago I was jobless, with only 7 bucks in my pocket, desperate. I’ve had luck to hear about this website from a good friend, and he recommended me to try, since he was making five-figures/month. After 4 months on this job, my latest pay was $5789 and keeps raising. Keep reading this page for all details and possibly apply http://jobnet8.com
Check out my remix of this song on my channel<3 blesses

RIP old LP
Wait, oh hell no. good song but this isnt Linkin Park
UGHHH I LOVE ITTTTT

Love this song and dont know why
i love it
I like the new sound
I love this song sm!
😎😎😍
Why does this song suck so bad?
ohh ok umm...
this is sooo much like pop What the hell.
its lit fam
i'm in loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee I loved Linkin park before but omg
More rock, Come on
Overall not a bad song, but the fact that it has the name Linkin Park behind it upsets me.  Wish they would go back to their roots (Meteora & Hybrid Theory).
Jus awesome...Can't fuckin wait for "One more light"!
Love it!
love it
really good
May 19TH is ten days after my birthday! I'm so happy!
this song is the best one yet
Yes... new style but same love group.
it sounds pretty well. but it is a huge change...
amazing 
love it!!!!!!!
beautiful song!
@wolfchick5687253: there's guitar in the 2nd and last chorus, you have to listen carefully
wow...guys what happened, why is everything so poppy 😢
linkin
i like it not maroon 5 or justin beiber its Linken
@coldquake: I guess our definitions of mainstream are far from similar. I did love a thousand suns though.
beautiful
@zsquared-doe: "A thousand suns" is experimental (far from mainstream). That was also LP... "Hybrid Theory" and "Meteora" were also far from mainstream. Not to mention "Reanimation". That was all Linkin fucking Park!
Like this different style of LP :)
Chester's voice is like my security blanket, or a light on the herizon telling me things will get better!
@ddjjdannygrussi: Same
and again a song speaks out of my heart
@coldquake: Well LINKIN PARK is mainstream. Crazy concept
I take that back. I don't really like it, probably because I'm a rock girl at heart.
Nice, but quite a change from the rock part. Where's the guitar?
definitely gives the tingles and raising of the hair. good work folks.
Heavier version: https://soundcloud.com/nicmrayce/linkin-park-heavy-nic-m-rayce-rock-remix-remastered
The song is fucking good, ignore the haters
Anyone else waiting May 19th 
@zsquared-doe: No... Because it's mainstream grabage.
oh my god, stupid idiots
A very beautiful song! You've grown! Excellent vocals and emotional lyrics touched my heart. You help me to survive.
what voice is that?
Regardless of old LP i personally like this, it grows on you.Every person has other preferences to explore.
it's different but its not that bad
collab with kiiara...
Something new from LP...Love It!
LP coming out with a new LP?
OMG THIS IS AMAZING! LINKIN PARK GOING POP LOL! U STILL SOUD OERFECT, CHESTER!
@jonny404: because it's not Meteora or Hybrid Theory?
I dig this
This is BAD and you should FEEEL BAD
@ddjjdannygrussi: ya
fuckin lit 👌🔥
I wish that there wasn't a need to appeal to new generations. I appreciate the production. Is this even LP?
30 sec is noooot enough! 😢😢
ooh it's really good I love it!
i love this and i love LP <3
first comment: awesome track!!!! :D
