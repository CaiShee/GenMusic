😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Just added this to my "bedroom boom" mix

Amazing vocals, smooth melody. - but that part "appreciate my hair even if it' nappy." rubbed me the wrong way. That's your natural hair - so how else should it be in order for a man to love it/you? Naah.

What's up Imaneurope I currently teamed up with a music agency that would usually get local to small-time artists like your self, thousands of plays from actual fans. We are trying to help more local based artists get the recognition they deserve. This is where I would come in, I was on your page not too long ago and came across your tracks, thought it was impressive and definitely see talent. The agency will get this done for around 250, but I can help by getting this down to 10. Ifyou are interested, here's the code: tenviral and you're set http://adremusviral.club
