Beautifully done. Touching.
this I relate to so much,  my father abandoned me at 4 years old and I looked for him found him once wanted to just talk and ask questions but he never gave me the chance to do that so I felt worthless because I didn't understand why he left but it happened for a reason 😩🥀
A talented person and a beautiful human.  🥀🥀

And a farther could stay. Not even sure I felt away about that... before this. Crazy Right?

first idol
i watched it
so sad

Before it was skipping the parts 
I knew this song when I watch Ellen interviewed Kelly. I like this version more than the remix one, and I like the emotion she put in the song as well. Everytime I listen to this song, I share with her the soul of the song and feel the pain and the happiness she has. <3 Thank you Kelly!
and all I remember is your back
Beatifull song
such a lovely song
