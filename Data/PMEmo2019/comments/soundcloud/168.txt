Lovely, Cole Swindell you're the best singer ever i am gonna play this on my electric guitar AMAZING KEEP IT UP! -Progressive Friends
It's a very commercial sound, very well produced.  The song has a story (country music requirement.) It's a slick, predicatble, well organized presentation.
like my music
SWINDAIL???
the promotion said Miles Davis Ghetto Walkin' and it sent me here. I feel swindled
Love it
i dont like the picture, the guy and his name looks like dumb country music

This is a nice song i really enjoy it!!!!!! When I listen to this I get in my filling!!!!

great song, i like it.
@oriwantsbeats: this is not country. it's morphed into some weird pop music base with cheesy lyrics that is marketed towards pre-teen girls and wanna be cowboys
hell no
HELL FUCKIN YEAAAAAAAAHH!!!
why tf is this promoted
nice reminds me of my bae
if i see another picture of some white boy faggot like that im going to kill myself
is that an 808 clap? really? i hate country more every day
Hip Hop Country???  Blah!
Hail Southern
