on't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works
sorry to hear that

This is Reaper from Overwatch's theme song
sound of silence usually sang by my beloved papa..where it kills me coz i miss him so much...
This is really awesome, but i miss the 2-part harmony from the original. Also, i wish they had a slower, softer ending, instead of the choppy cut-off
@shadow-ph0enix: true..
the original is way better..
they did it brilliant. my favorite still is the cover that The Awakening did, be sure to have a listen too that one aswell

This song represents todays songwritters, and the youth that try to mimic them, only to be outshined by Big Music.
A true remaster, Disturbed covered this song and did it great justice, Simon and Garfunkle would be happy!

I love how they remade a old song and gave it new life
@dante-silva-39685301: No one likes your rap music, Rap isn't music. It's talking about women and abusing them in sexual and non sexual ways, calling a girl a hoe isn't your business. If she likes sex, then she does, too bad so sad. That's all rap is about. And money and drugs. Go listen to some real music and maybe people won't hate you so much, Seriously.
because these visions....softly ease creeping
This song brings me chills everytime!
