@stuartbrown55: thats how it should be
@user17552007: fuck off
@moxix: true
nope
Not for me
ass
why does this keep playing when I don't want it to??? 
Radio 2 fodder,   Nicely done tho!
@user-873782079: Guess it depends on whether one is trying to make money out of it. If one is, then it's business development, same as any other form of marketing. If you're a hobbyist or (like me) a semi-pro in a highly niche market, promotion is less of a big deal.
@user-204695922: My thoughts precisely. My own stuff is extremely niche, I don't expect many to like it, I'm happy with doing my own thing and if a few folk catch on, so much the better. But promote a track on SoundCloud? Not something I've done nor do I intend doing it.
``198ai-pm
sounds amazing bro. real proud of you!! keep them coming :)
meh, i wouldnt listen to this if hillary clinton paid me
o so shit

@jamee-summers: agreed

basic crap
KEEMSTAR
lets get right into the news
terrible
Worst thing I have ever heard.
The industry is fucked when it pays money to force a dead track infront of thousands of people. How about you make good music, and let people come to you.
Dude you sold out
its a bit wet...
Bullshit.
got it as promoted track, think its rubbish
@natusmusic: well spotted
just very bad
love it
i have just been sick and it was yellow
pedo pop music
Fuck off

love this song, great remix,
Awesome
LIKE
love it o
good shit
Peaceful :)
@stuartbrown55: Well, that's debatable. But &gt;this&lt; type of promoting, yes.
@user-489871117: stop hating
I'm not going to play it - it may or may not be good; but nothing that is genuinely good needs promoting. Just saying.
well played dude... this is top music

Island Records appear to be paying quite a bit to Soundcloud to get their Division Four artists some promotion. This is pretty dire.
