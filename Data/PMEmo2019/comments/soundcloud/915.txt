@parth-masekar: Just stop
@richard-trawick: Just stop I don't care much for cod but at this point these comments are just "Rip COD", "Battlefield 1' yeah we get it Battlefield 1 has this song in it and cod is dying but there is littleraly no reason to post this bullshit since everyone else already has. Sorry I went on a rant there
