Not bad but quite different from usual Sigma stuff. 🙅
Nice that
yesss vibesss
WOW this is terrible.Also; 'find me' isn't a very good title for something that you force people to listen to. Should be called 'endure me', and the answer would be no.
tick tick
I'm obsessed with this song! Millie Bobby Brown in the video totally helps as well. She's the best! <3
Millie Bobby Brown brought me here.
hmmmmm not a fan guys wateva.
