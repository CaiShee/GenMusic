@innatum: This song certainly makes it's fair share of mistakes, I don't deny that haha:) There's a distinct possibility you're right haha
@llamas_official: I honestly think it was a mistake.  I think the piano or another audio track was supposed to be gated, not every bit of the song.  If how it is was intentional, I'd be surprised.  It sounds awful
<3
repeat all day long!!!!!
@inzlua2igqi6: :D
@ben-brown-68: Oh didn't expect to see you here

@athenisclothingcompany: lmfao
@ben-brown-68: I get it, they need revenue streams, but just give me ads and serve me a subscription - don't auto play rubbish. The Soundcloud audience is making themselves heard, time to LISTEN to that. Otherwise people will stop using the service.
@amelias-profile: Yeah, but it's like everyday i gotta auto listen to some crap. I get it, they need revenue streams, but just give me ads and serve me a subscription - don't auto play rubbish. The Soundcloud audience is making themselves heard, time to LISTEN to that.
Wow this is nonsense, 97.8k plays cos it AUTO PLAYS WHEN THE PAGE LOADS - Stop it Soundcloud.
i actually like the song dont @ me

soundcloud lost their USP :(

This is not what we expect to be showcased on our dance feeds, please relook at how tracks are selected
Kill this MOFO this is a shit track.
This comment schizophrenia is making my day
beautiful
dafuq is this
fuck off
mad
soundcloud y u do this?
I don't pay money to soundcloud for promoted tracks on my feed .Get it off
Soundcloud is not about promoted stuff, this is poor. If it wasn't promoted it wouldn't be at the top of my stream, and that's how it should be. Tracks like this should stay out of my stream, hidden because I don't want to hear or see this type of garbage!
so I pay to upload stuff ('cos then I get to order it - WOW !), yet I get adverts and other peoples stuff in my face, while a casual sign upper gets buckets of music for nothing...gotta love the internet...
Nice 1!! Add me for fresh hip hop instrumentals...
The fuck is this!?
fuck you soundclouddd
old charlie puth! loving it
Rubbish
fuck what is this shiat
SHITE
Beast!
@jay-brum: lmao

this ignorant shit offends my ears
(Ohhhhhhh) (Ohhhhhho)  Awesome TRACK!
soundcloud selling out? SC used to be real.
VERY poor
such a tune this!!!
Judging by the comments, selling out to shitty ads makes you money, but gets you no respect.
@lx-nen: Tyvm
O this is...fucking cancerous
this track is killing it , by it i mean soundcloud , this is awful , never going to by anything from this artist or label , this promotion has totally failed
XD Hahaha I can't unhear "I'm facing a butthole"

Big ibiza tune!

"ohhhh oh/I'm facing the butthole   Ohhhh oh/For all of my trouble
