Don’t read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now you’ve started reading this don’t stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works

honestly this is not the version I expected from the remix, when I heard it live it was a very different version and much better than this one, you changed the vowels of the drop and other things literally it's not the same, I expected the same version that you hear live, I hope and can get some version of that remix

@user-971032926: You've commented the same thing to many people not liking the song, I think you're the one who needs the attention... That or your way too into Skrillex.

@bvssicmusic: gotta take leaps of faith sometimes but i did it and i wont stop here
@bvssicmusic: thanks I remixed it lmfao lol and yes I stole Rip n Dip and did that to draw attention to my shit but as they never copy right strike it me and i remade it into a new song it was a new song from the original that song when i did that i was still learning how to use FL Studio in my early days of learning FL Studio and i didn't understand  much of what i was doing so yes I'm not afraid to admit to shit honestly and I'm still learning everything I'm doing as for the song I did on the humble remix other than the parts that were originally from Kendrick Lamar's humble i did makes those other beats myself. Thank you for the comment.
hi i luv u
dope
@getouthoeits6am: Nah it's different
@klyzerg: He's always produced a variety.
@samsin111: Okay you won. Funniest comment here by far.
@davidahlstrom: Here's the attention you wanted
@mstofficial: Not the same guy. Medasin is just a dude riding Skrill's coattails in the wake of this song's hype.
@jagg010: Obviously not
@3299: Skrillex =/= Quix
@mitchelltorres: Here's the attention you're looking for
@doumams-cisse-la-lib-rt: Found the troll
@munk: I'm gonna go with "or what"

The production..... what is this sorcery
@mistro-ts: i actually do make my own sounds man lol but thank you bro
*shouldnt
@am3r1c4npsycho: Hey man, I gave it a listen, its not bad, but in the future you probably should use to much loops and make your own sounds, be unique and keep going try your hardest to make top quality music, it takes time to perfect but it is worth it once you realize the progress you have made. Good Luck! <3

@glencoemusic: you can man! with your miiiind lol. no, but for real, a good exercise i like to do is listen to a few songs i like with my eyes closed, and try to picture what's going on in the project file in my mind as it's playing.

@zodiak7: freal tho. Anyone who thinks Skrillex has to steal from another artist is just silly.
fuk yeah
Itunes??? Hey man, upload
this remix has won 
@user-496593870 nice, let me hear it when you get a chance. I have some similar snare samples I can send you
cool
<3
these guns wtf 😂
trap is good
@user-496593870: Thought you meant the entire drop. Because it is blatantly obvious that the snare at 0:51 has the vocal sample hit at the same time. That does not mean the "snare is made from the vocal sample" at the drop, like you said. Simply, the vocal plays at the same time as the snare, they are separate samples.
aaa yeeea
@user-496593870: Yes, that is the one I'm referring to. I said that the snare layer at 1:20 is overlaid on another snare sample in the main drop (0:50). The snare at 50 secs is layered with the vocal shot as well, but the vox is not in every snare hit in the drop.
These Medasin comments need to fucking stop!

@user-496593870: PM me the snare you have, I'd like to hear it
@user-496593870: I've heard this generic snare sample many times, doesn't sound like it's created in any meticulous way. Listen to the snare layer at 1:20, sounds like that is layered with another snare sample in the main drop.
Can we get a full-on collab track from k.dot & skrillex?! 🔥
Let us not forget who really helped make this @medasin lol https://soundcloud.com/officialmedasin/territory
@user-496593870: No, it is a snare sample layered with the vocal shot in certain snare hits.

@otr: Ye true the mastering/mixing is great. But it still sounds generic and boring in my opinion
@corezdubstepriddim: the mix is by far the best thing I've heard in awhile. How everything sits is just perfect. The way it's mastered is art in itself.
@linkomusic: It's so generic though. This track legit lack creativity plus work. Skrillex back then actually put a lot of creativity and effort on his stuff.

@theofficialkromatix: Lmfao did you say, 'I recognize Skrillex's lack of audio engineering talent' He's miles ahead of any of us. Btw he put a good amount of saturation on his bass synth hits, it's not like its distorted from clipping. You're good though I just wanted to say that lol.

Dd
@epic-monsterlegends: who are you again
@theofficialkromatix: the highs are fine. the the bass synth is distorted on purpose. unless you're talking about the sub, which isn't distorting. or the brass. which isn't distorting either.

@ex-ninety-three: cant comment THEIR opinion**
@ex-ninety-three: literally all of these comments are their opinions, talking about its "fire". im not salty, im just talking. also, i'm not stopping them listening to the song, they can still read a comment while listening. technology can do amazing things. so you basically dont want me to comment. if people cant comment my opinion, then the comment section is only for being sucking skrillex off and fire emojis. stop getting angry about my opinion.
@robindplondon: how is retarded for having an opinion? unless this comment is ironic, then you're the retard.
i love uuuuuuuuu
the mixdown is fucking fire
Kendrick is Horrible but skrillex actually made this a good song

fuckk yeh

omg
@bbloomusic: if you have any constructive feedback to give on other tracks id love to hear. im happy to give my opinion on yours too, but you obviously think youre superior and know everything about mixing and music
NICE
<<check out my tracks. Won't be disappointed 
@bbloomusic: this account is for unmixed song ideas and work in progresses. that's not a final mix, so i your opinion is invalid to me. i agree, its badly mixed, can't wait to fix it. calling my stuff "trash" is totally uncalled for. if you were nice about it i would appreciate the feedback, but you're a fucking faggot so i dont.
Wtf, skrillex, leave our good music alone dammit
subelo a deezer   please

@3299: LMFAO this statement is so funny and sad at the same time...
Dude omg
This is so hard!! Those horns
Meh..
@lunadub: Nothing wrong with beats thoe, i use the pros. And a lot of producer prefer the Pros over much cheaper studio headphones, so nothing wrong with beats
@lunadub: i do appreciate good music. just because i recognize skrillex's lack of audio engineering talent doesn't mean i dont appreciate it. i appreciate it for what he's doing. i think its god-awful, but i still respect it.
@theofficialkromatix: you should stop criticising and start appreciating good music
this track is fire. everyone eat shit. 
Fuck this is good
Fuck yes
You know its actually pretty good but like... are you just doing this for popularity?
@theofficialkromatix: just my opinion
btw i like your music a lot. my favorite is "a note". i also listened to 00, which would sound a thousand times better if you got rid of all that compression.
Why Skrillex wanna be QUIX so bad??
flames
@ittsukii: i dont know how you aren't hearing it. its like people are desensitized to good mixing from current pop songs.
sicc
@lunadub: of course not, i hate beats.
Best producer ever !
It's FINALLY up. Yeeee, Skrill.
Skrillex really needs to drop music more frequently. We know he can do some insane stuff..
@punkerrr: i 1+ this, the mixdown is absolutely fine
#Skrillex_Kingdom
@theofficialkromatix: Im listening on my beats right now aka highboosted headphone and I'm not hearing anything too loud in the high freqs other than mayb the hi hats but thats hi hats for you.
this is fucking amazing

OMG OMG ! ASWEWEAWeAD AWESOME !
wow
ive been waiting and its worth the wait 
hol up bitch

finallly

lit
#Skrillex_Kingdom <3
Holy Cow!
@wow-such-url: im listening again and am finding some slight distortion from one of the bass synths
@iam_abz: but the bass synth is distorting and the highs are extremely loud.
Always sooo clean
mad 
D A M N
He is Fucking Back Again!
holop
holly shit
nice
@crine-miveloc: fakk deg
@wow-such-url: just because it shows that its mixed well in the waveform doesnt necessarily mean anything. it can still be loud and obnoxious. the waveform showing that it's fine means that its compressed to shit. i've also noticed that loud highs are a trend in current music. usually snares in new hip hop songs are freaking insanely loud. idk. just my opinion.
super dope!!!!!!!!!!!!fuckkkkk
sickk!!
Bars so dope 
finally
so fucking well done
dope shitty litty 🔥🔥🔥🔥
you know whats up skril
Sick!
waaaaah

one of the best drops by skrillex
sick bro keep finally u made something intersting after year
Holly Fvck  So Hot man
What an amazing comeback from Skrillex.
dum dam dum damm
oomg
siiiiiiiick
wow
damn
YES
HOLY SHIET!!!! THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING!!!!!!
@theofficialkromatix: but if you download the waveform you can see only the kick and snare peak, the rest of the highs are dynamically mixed
@wow-such-url: I wasn't talking about only the kicks, I was talking about all the highs. If he just brought the volume down on some things, it would sound really nice. I like that he's using less compression now, too. It's still there, but he's learning. (ACCIDENTALLY TAGGED MYSELF THE FIRST TIME I POSTED THIS)
@wow-such-url: I know it's not original, I was saying that so I wouldn't get too much shit lol. I have good speakers, that's not the issue. Also, a good mix/master should be playable on anything. I shouldn't have to have super high-end equipment to bare the mixing.
🖕
@wow-such-url: it's not an "original idea" lol it's the concept behind 80% of all hip hop kicks, it's literally everywhere
@theofficialkromatix: audio engineers use this technique to create warmth in tracks so maybe you should get some new speakers
@wow-such-url: soft-clip peaking doesn't mean that it sounds good
@theofficialkromatix: so does Quincy Jones, what's your point
@michael-dailey-3: he has an average iq
@fritjof-sounds: either way, whatever you want to call it. im not the best audio engineer, but it literally hurts to listen to this. it's a good, original idea but you'd think skrillex would know how to make music by now.
@theofficialkromatix: nothing's clipping
@theofficialkromatix: not clipping, soft-clip peaking
@zboxmusic: the highs are clipping. idk how people are listening to this without bleeding ears.

@iano9: again it's a very simple melody. The track I was referring to was Damn by Joyryde. That track seems more likely for the inspiration given he plays that track in his sets.

@rachel-johns-7: I don't think that's a remix. Would like to find out what it is though.
WHAT THE FUCK
@weasel_cafe: ah ok hmm, i think its a Random Coincident that they sound similar.
@ben-king-85: is there an isolated sample anywhere?
OMG Q EMOÇAUM ♡
@eliae: might just be a coincidence
@john-falk-2: Its caled territory
@eliae: how? sorry but using synthesized brass patches in trap music is too common to be considered stealing. However I do believe Skrillex may have drew influence from that track, just as he must have done from JOYRYDE too.

Steps on how to make frosting: In medium bowl, mix powdered sugar and butter with spoon or electric mixer on low speed. Stir in vanilla and 1 tablespoon of the milk. Gradually beat in just enough remaining milk to make frosting smooth and spreadable. If frosting is too thick, beat in more milk, a few drops at a time.
Can't wait for this to dominate iTunes and Beatport
also 33k in one hour jesus titting christ
