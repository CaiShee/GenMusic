Turn Up! ①

sick beat drop
Dope

Awesome
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!1
song starts here btw
love this
@peninsula-3: sorry dude you can't really become a song, it's just physically impossible. And I'm glad you don't give a a shit because that would be about as bad as this song. And you need to learn that some people are mlg hardcore and when someone disagrees with you, you normally get into an argument. Welcome to reality people!
@braxbro: that seems like what Monstercat would do these days
#mellogang Please check out my remix of Vicetone's track Siren - Astrobe-973474378 – Siren-ft-pia-toscano-astrobe-remix

I don't understand how this is trap music.
nice
DOPE!! im a 13 year old music producer check out my dubstep!!https://soundcloud.com/user-26837348
@notdubfreak: Or he could be using a lower quality track so that everyone is surprised when he comes out with a good one.
@makeelectrogreatagain: Mind reader?
Noice
why are people hating this, i think it's so good
I love thissong!!!!!
lakkrrrr

@notdubfreak: "i am sad", he thought to himself because he is sad.

Such a beautiful track. I hope to hear some more like this masterpiece.

They removed the #Melodic trap. Why? :'(
@test-drive-4: agree
Base boosted will kill
@user-341767647: Wrong Site

@vladimir-rink: me too
FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 on my page! Check me out!
awesome intro
absolutely INCREDIBLE!
MARSHMELLO!! AMAZING JOB <3
HOLY CRAP! MARSHMELLO?!?! WELCOME TO MCAT BUDDY!!
@aeris-music-chill: it was a joke....
And I thought it was going to be an 8-bit song!
Marsh mellows r gud
Wow sound amazing you're awesome
@andlestick: That's a very closed minded way of listening to music.
@wolflash: makes sense. His other shit tho...MUCH more unique.
@czaz: Yes. Could have been way better with some work on it.
@miles-majure-barkley-1: 100 % agree
@aeris-music-chill: i'm not mc fanbase. Slips&Slurs, Deon Custom, Slushi, they had their own style, with their own sounds. Not as this guy. This kind of "style" nothing to do here.
@andlestick: I agree. for me it sounds like a beginner having fun on a keyboard. such not an interessing piece.
Solid style!
Marshmello on MONSTERCAT? dope
Yay cover 8-bit so cool :3 !
P.s can anyone find the golem inside the song banner #easteregg
New intro music found
LOVE IT
mi libro luna de pluton xD
@andlestick: At least three sounds?  Do you even produce?  There isn't a chance Marhmello had less than three sounds in this drop.  It's beautifully simple and he can make that work.  Honestly it makes me sad that you would even associate this track with this shit fanbase.
beat dro[
beat drop incoming
wait for it
holy
beat drop
lav IT!
@aeris-music-chill: Don't quote EDEN on me, there is a large majority of this fanbase who is restricted to just this channel, I am not one of them. I listen to popular EDM sometimes and I'm seeing this kind of music trend. Just becasue it's released on Monstercat has nothing to do with it being diverse. This is honestly one of the least diverse tracks released lately IMO...
@notdubfreak: I would like at least 3 sounds in my drops thank you very much....
OH M GERSH
out of nowhere
damn
damn
@notdubfreak: Generic tracks are what bring out the specialties in others, maybe this was not meant to be a prize winner. A reminiscent to the past when we did not have cheesy noise; I can listen to this because it reminds me of what respect truly requires. I'm a nerd, ain't I?
mello af
whoa
#pornrepost
marshmello on monstercat?
awesome, amazing, love it so far!!!!!!!!!
best channel ever
DAB DAB DAB DAB
what a nice sweet
its aight
Straight fresh.
!!!!!!
<3
i like marshmello, but this kinda fell flat for me. not bad by any means, but not the best.
i like it idk why people dont 
@cameron_mcillwain: Just because it's a weak drop doesn't mean it's a bad song. Instead of listening to every detail of the song, try playing it and letting the emotion behind it flow through your body. Then you'll like the song.
@nels_music: Plus, I do agree that this track in particular was a bit lacking. His other stuff, though...
@nels_music: THat's just his style. He doesn't usually throw in a million different sounds at once, it IS basic. Just like how minimalist design is basic but very pleasing to the eye, or how superhot is a game with a very basic design, but is still an amazing game.
love the drop
Marshmello on monstercat  heck yes
Ouu
@andlestick: HOWEVER, I will agree that this one song in particular was a bit lacking. His other stuff is all amazing.
@loltitties: Uh, because people like his music?
@makeelectrogreatagain: "heh", he thought to himself thinking he's clever and funny.
@nels_music: Okay, then you do it. Good luck.
@andlestick: Just because it doesn't have a million different sounds happening when the drop hits doesn't mean it's generic in the slightest.
@andlestick: Please put some reasoning behind these claims. All you've done is complained about it being "generic" without and solid reasons why. I feel like you're saying this simply because many people like his work and happen to find it unique.
Pretty good. Not his best song, but a good MC debut track, for sure. Keep it up my man!
@user404074726: yo
@andlestick: ********************************in your opinion
@andlestick: Generic???? You are joking right?  I'm not a big Marshmello fan, but i do respect his music and how innovative it really can be.  I saw a comment on this saying "weak drop lost all respect i had for this song".  How the hell is that respect for Marshmello's music?  Honestly, if anything this shows how disgustingly, obnoxiously, and annoyingly close-minded you all really are.  in the words of EDEN, "your tunnel vision haunts you".  Open up your ears and listen to music the way it's supposed to be heard.  Case closed.
@cameron_mcillwain: You need to learn that some songs aren't meant to be hardcore mlg destroy ur ears base boosted
@district_3: idk about that
I liked the Slushii track because there was actually something to listen to, but this is utterly bland. He tries to make the drop interesting, but it just isn't. I can't stand to listen to that awfully cheesy build-up. Without the name, Monstercat would never have signed this....
Oh my ****!!
@cameron_mcillwain: ok go ahead and leave dude the other 11000 of us really dont give a shit
@the-best-tracks: more like just good connections....
@jordacus: "Different spin" yeah ok
@notdubfreak: They sign songs, not artists....
@aeris-music-chill: based on how generic this song is, that's just saying how diverse the community really is...
@vladimir-rink: go to Saiko
i never seen hate comments here before
O SHT! again
OSHT!
Best part
Simply amazing, i never hear melody trap before and i got addicted by this music, amazing work @marshmellomusic
love it marshmello <3

Welcome to the family marshmello
i heard this lead in the Serum maybe from "ACS Halycon" Presets
ignore the haters man this song is beautiful
I don't know what some people here are commenting about, but this musical for all.
@Feral Sounds like what every girl in bed with you WOULD say.
I don't know why everyone is hating on you but this is the shit. Thank you Monstercat for giving me the chance to know of Marshmallow.
1:35 is where it all starts! ❤
LOOOVVVEEE YOUU MARSHHHMELLLOO!!!!
thx for every song you made
good fade in
dang

wow that weak drop just killed ANY interest I had in this song, bye
plz dont suck
Sonny Moore/ Skrillex Vocal Sample?
@miles-majure-barkley-1: salty
colorful :D
♡
I dont like you, Marshmello. Your tracks are something that a beginner could crank out in 2 days and the fact that Monstercat sponsors you doesn't mean you're good.
im not feelin original mc. but i like it. i wish i could hea some more 'real' melodic and chill trap from mc
|×_×|
lovely song!! <3
Very hyped to see Marshmello on Monstercat, sick track dude :D
fits in so well with the monstercat family
@siddharthjoshi: Ty
[✖‿✖]
@czaz: I kind of agree with you, but it's not that bad, it's just not "finished"
Great Work!
Awesome!
#Melodic Trap?!? Can´t be bad
this is ridiculous
ohhh turn up your bass this shit is amazing
@czaz: It's nice that you're trying to express your opinion. But sorry to cut it to you, this is the internet and no one gives a shit.
nice!

Not such loving thos
@voxicmusic: It's pretty simple, but it has V I B E S
it's too quier

@nolanvanlith: The guy has a point. The instruments clash together a bit too much. All producers would understand this problem.

@thechimchar: yes

@czaz: Yeah, I get your point :) At the end of the day it is music taste I guess but you should check out Grey, they are easily my favorite music producers and also Stephen. I do actually have a decent taste in music lol
why is this shit so addicting omfg, mellooogaaaaaaaang
MARSHMELLO + MONSTERCAT BESTT SHITT EVER
<3
6/10.. Dude is wayyyy overrated.
hi im dr!pl!ne
Dotcomm
best marshmello original in a while
good work!
@forerunner-official: I think that marshmello comes up with really cool melodys and sick synths and it is different from a lot of the stuff you hear these days. I think that is one of the best things about future bass, it is a genre that you can do so much with and Marshmello has put his own spin on it.
not his best
sounds just like "with you, friends" by skrillex... No originality in electronic music anymore smh
omg marshmello on monstercat
@h3ndobeatz: gtfo with that lmao just because kids dedicate their time to things other than music doesn't mean they can't have an opinion on it
Very good c:
dank af <3
ok!!!!!
YEEESSSS
MARSHMELLO ON MONSTERCAT?!?!? my deam has came true!

X___X
@loltitties: How are you such a dick?!?! He has gotten to be big because of his refreshing original sound. He has his own style just like other artists and that is what seperates him so stop being a hater and do something more useful with your time!
@loltitties: it's sound ok to me
