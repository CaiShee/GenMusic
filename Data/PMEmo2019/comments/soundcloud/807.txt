@steven-rodriguez-96766912: You are disgusting. He did his best and this is what you say? How dare you., You should be ashamed.
@user-922634007: At least eh sang it. Stop hating.
@horrorluv: WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM
@horrorluv: OH Y GOD YOU ARE SO HORRIBLE
@user-925809772: You are so rude. Maybe instead o9f being  ajerk, think of how long he practiced. Your voice is prolly worse than his.
@nomadicbum9888231: You are disgusting. If you have something rude to say, keep it to yourself. If you dont like it, just dont listen to the song.
@user-898694821: You should be ashamed of yourself. Your voice prolly worse than his
All of you are horrible. He must have practiced for hours and this is what we say? All of you who making fun of him or saying that he should delete this should be ASHAMED. What if you sang something that you poured your heat into and most of the people told you to delete it? How would you feel if people told you your voice was garbage or trash? How would you feel? All of you rude people are disgusting. His voice is beautiful and you can come fight me if you think otherwise. (P.S Ill win. Jerks.)
@that-guy-246642863: Thats rude! Dont say that. His voice is amazing. At least he was brave enough to sing this.
Hey! Guys! Dont say that! Its the thout that counts. His voice is beautiful. Maybe he was nervous. You guys are rude.
Oh
its not even that bad
Tell me why i thoght this was the normal song so i put it on my night time playlist , yet i woke up outta my sleep and changed it 😭
Take this shit off please
