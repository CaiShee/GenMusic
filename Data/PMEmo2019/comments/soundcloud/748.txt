heyyyy
This song got me through a hard time in my life.  PARTYNEXTDOOR's unique sound is what inspired me to keep going with my music.  It is OK for men to be emotional and show their feelings.  PND and Drake changed Hip-Hop forever and I'll always be grateful for their music.
OMG I love it 😍

This My Shit Right Here!
Wallace: My total earnings for first month was very low... Just little over $250, but it was then when I realized this is the real deal and not yet another scam you see all over the internet! There are no words to describe the feeling you get when your first paycheck arrives and what excitement I felt at that moment realizing that making money from home is in fact very possible. After my first month I dedicated more time and put more effort in working this and my second month was already much more better (2nd paycheck I got was for $990)... Now, 6 months later, I am earning just over $2500 a month . I am a little slow with my work and I am not that good with computers and that's why I think a younger person could be able to earn much much more than this... ============ http://www.ReportMax90.Com

Well Drake, my ig is joconway03. someone tell him to message me to resolve this.
oh the irony, I just caught this now. that is something crazy
I wrote everything on your song called "Come And See Me"
Very funny how I did this right
just come out and say it strait. stop with this symbolism and secret ism.
the little boy in the field getting picked on is you when you were a little boy
for gods sake look at the symbolism in your music video energy
like you were once verbally and mentally abused
You have 24 hours to acknowledge, that you have been exaggerating and faking your music to stay atop of the National Spotlight, and then Drake I will forgive you for selling yourself out and hurting the kids of our time
You decide drake. I will stop now. If i dont get a direct message within 24 hours. let those bot accounts repreat this information on everyone of your social media account until the end of time. every instagram, soundcloud, everything. and drake additionally if you do not catch wind of this within the 24 hour period, then no that time is extend
@childsoldier: if you like check me out
so guy why are you using your power and influence to do no good to this world, but to spread negative energy
@whoiscori: if you like check me out
you did nota feel that you fit in
white kids
in a jewish school
you say you were picked on left and right growing up
i totally respect your hustle and work ethic. i am the same way
@shelbey-leigh-leco: if you like check me out
your are bright as the sun, a pure musical genius of our time. all of you guys are. just stop corroding the kids and the masses

Im not even anything at that time and im already selling myself out
I used to write trash songs myself where I exaggerated to try and get more listens and fans
"storytellers, they aint even need a campfire" "i just want to tell the truth", bohemian grove symbolism. you never tell the truth drake. and by the way fans this lyric is from Drakes light up off his sophmore album Thank Me Later Ft. Jay Z
@madennyk: if you like check me out
Dont get it twisted. If you came out 100 % real i would totally support you and any artist
@barryallenmusic: check me out
@alk-lex: check me out if you like
Drake I love your music!
were corroding kids brains here, dont you see the negative impact of the music
that goes for every artist in The United States of America
i dont want to see you die, lose your money or anthing. im not a negative person. im spiritual. i want to see you be truthful to the masses.
pretending to be someone who i wasnt
i too was a lyer
i have every interview and link to those too. so yes, I can contradict you a thousand times
@jiipalacios: if you like check me
i watched everyone of your interviews
shot at Jeremih? lol
@mr-golfwang: iff you like plese check me
every thing i said about you was not false
i will stop there. but guy come on all the information about the Illuminati symbolism, and its influence on the music industry is the first search result
the owl bohemian grove here it is
Drake stands for Dracula
@138god: check me out
i am a whole hearted loving person. i am sick of seeing our culture destroyed by demonic music so i studied the music industry in its entirety
it promotes a bad atmosphere
this is what negative music does to the world
well i know how you feel because you wrote a letter about it
how do you feel about that
and 2 people got shot and killed outside after
how about your ovo event in toronto that you threw
im being real. step up to the plate
drake im not bullying you. im telling the world 100% facts about your life and my life at the same time.
the show Gossip Girl kills thousands of kids each year. it promotes secret online bullying
this music needs to stop
@user-383232932: check me out if you like
my mother suffered her entire life. caused her to have 5 miscarriges
@yusefdoodie: hey if you like check me out
you should have knocked him the fuck out
il stand up to domestic violence
il go toe to toe with chris on a song or a rap battle whatever he wants. pathetic
chris brown beat rihana
its time that this music must stop
music of this day and age destroys women
i hate men who denounce women.
she was abused by men. guns put in her face. beaten .
my mother is bi polar, manic depressive
taken away by foster care at the age of 2
I did not grow up with my parents
WHOa
<3
In love
i may do some crazy shit with my team. OVO and fake shit is not wanted in Boston
i may go picket Majid Jordans show march 30th at the House of Blues with signs and my video crew
fuck no though
about bringing OVO to BOSton at the clubs that I am affiliated with
Ob OBrians manager
I message PEEZY Before
Drake I bet you will have all of your boys message me too. threatening me
Join us! UK reggae sound history! https://www.facebook.com/SoundSystemArchives/
printed every article about you, i got them everywhere man. and im going to expose you. and use every word that you have ever said to prove that you are a patheolgical liar
you may need to call GOOGLE. but wait oh yeah i have everything saved off GOOGLE too so it really does not even matter
even bohemian grove. the first result on GOOGLE GUY
everything i say is proven
this is not bullying this is truth telling
This aint twitter Fingers, this is Soundcloud Bashing
Go make a mother fucking song about me? LIke I said Cuz I have the album ready to release again you too?
Fire back bro? Lets see what your bitch ass has to say?
Aubrey, is that why you are so emotional?\
Aubrey sounds like a chicks name to me
im going to message every person who hated u from toronto and knows who you really are "AUBREY GRAHAM"
dawg that aint you
it changed you
from there you got EXPOSED to the club lifestyle. "10,000" on the glass
you would drive down with your father to Memphis everysummer
your father was a musician. your uncle was a musician
made 40,000 a year in high school
great conenctions
an acura
you had a whole beautiful basement
i grew up in a DI Shiki mother fucka
fuck that drake mother fucka
you did not start from the BOTTOM LIKE CHIEF SAYS IN ONE OF HIS SKITS ON HIS MIXTAPE
you were so fucking blessed
your father is a former HEROIN ADDICT
your mother treated you so well
you love hockey over basketball
you played hockey
bro the shit u be on is a force
the black kids felt inferior in my town also, so we all hung out with one another
I grew up inferior to the other white kids in my town
I dont sleep for days at a time
il start posting thousands of pictures with anti drake tags that have 1,000-2,000 uplikes
@138god: These trash comments making me want to physically abuse you
dont believe me
Fade and tapthere
i was the #1 trending on two apps in the united states
my own real money cuz i earned it
my own money
vip in clubs killin shit
I threw parties 4-5 days a week. girls moet, don perignon, ace of spaces, moet
you cant fool boston. were too good for that
guess what we got Harvard, Mit, BC, BC, Northeastern. the best schools in the world are arguably right down the street from me
All of Boston and Massachusetts is going to become anti National Hip Hop
Otherwise I will spend every waking second bashing you and every major artist you assocaite with
man up. be honest to the National Media about your true intentions and we can proceed as friends.
i aint scared of none of yal.
drake my name is John Conway. i was raised in Mansfield Ma. Il fucking give u my address for gods sake
the whole rap game is using you
Subliminally making fun of people and not calling them out by name
you are like the show GOSSIP GIRL
your a bitch you dont call people out by name.
your a bitch and made fun of him sublminially in SUmmertime16
Tory Lanez hates you
you are not 6GOD
you are not God
now my idol is God
thats scary
@138god: only queers come out of boston
and not God himself
You were my IDOL
no fake kiss up to drake pathetic shit. im going to ask you the scariest questions that you ever heard
Cameras rolling. I will have my film crews there.
Well here we go because I never got a direct response from you to talk to me face to face like a man
I gave you 24 hours, yesteday on Gods day to reach out to me or I would start exposing you
we exposing you on snapchat, instagram. im teaching every person about your fakeness and connection to the OWL symbolism and Behomian Grove
@138god: shut up you baby back bitch
fuck drake
all of umass is on my wave now
bro you are not influencing this generation anymore
"Influence a generation thats lacking impatience"
come on guy
you fuck strippers and prostitutes
You are not a nice guy
you are decitful, disrespectful
Girls like you cuz you appear emotiona
Grow a pair
Emotional
Your soft
Now you attach to Steph Curry and Odel Beckham like a LEECH
dude your whole fucking album was written by Quentin Miller
you had your number 1 hit to catipult you into stardome
and boom
you and 40 did a minor tweak like your entire IF YOUR READING THIS ITS TOO LATE ALBUM
he wrote the entire thing
yes on wikipedia he has a credit on the song
il go to all the magazines, papers, etc yal are all so fucking fake
how come u locked them in the studio for 6 months then publically barely gave them credit
that was their song
40 you know it too
Majid should be massive in the world not you
YOu should not even be on the song
Huh BRo WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
how come it does not say Featuring Majid Jordan?
Hold On Were Going Home was my Favorite Song
Were sick of hearing you mother fuckers everyday in the clubs
you have no idea what me and my friends experienced
you think im fucking scared of you pretenders
I was physically abused as a child
I was just an incredable salesman
Neither am i actually
Your a pussy you aint about that life
i ran the colleges in Massachusetts
I sold 40 grand of drugs at a time
Delete me. My team will create 5 million accounts. And no we are not the group Anynomous. We are real people. we aint no bitches
I hope every person listening to this song hears these comments
bro, come on, your the farthest fucking from Knowing Yourself
Your brand is called "Know Yourself"
those girls got to your head
that money got to your head
what the fuck happened
you were humble. soft spoken
you once were a great genuine kid who cared about his grandmother
i saw the interview with your mother when you were younger
u are not about that life
they say ur a bitch and cant go out to the projects cuz ur fake as fuck
Do you want it to go
I have a song called "Up In Toronto" with them waiting to Go!!
P Reigns neighborhood
i talk to several artists In Scarborough
Well see how far your Reign goes
being fake. lying to the masses
keep doing what ur doing guy
I my friend, and my friends, and all the geniuses working for me, have time on our hands
Not this second. not today. not tomorrow
In Time
and I personally will
Now I want to end OVO
I grew up wantin to work, write, and be an artist for OVO
I must acknowledge you are incredable at spotting talent
Fetty Wap
Kodak Black
you jump on peoples wave
Its fake as fuck
we watching OVO how it moves
and so do my friends
because i know where it is
If aint your safe house no more
Crib in Calibassa
id punch u in the face, if we were in old times, but youd probably sue my family
diddy pimped slapped u like a little girl
you are a sneaky bitch
cuz im a fuckin beast and u suck and pay people to write ur shit cuz ur consumed lying to girls and fucking them over
I wrote the whole album in 1 day
the album will have "6Songs"
exposing all of you fake fucks in the music business. dj khaled. rock ross every one of you
and im starting in Boston
have your heads in the toilet
ahhhh
and all of OVO
il rip you apart when it comes to Kelsey Grammor
guy u could not pass high school until your 20's
then College student of Law and accounting
im a 3.9 student
Then i realzied your a piece of shiot
I wanted to grow up being you
You were my idol
you are my favorite artist, well were
Im not saying you suck as an artist
and Lil Waynes
Just watch
Just watch guy
I personally will end your reign
they loved you over everyone because you grew up jewish
the music industry is prominently jewish owned.
I realized you are the biggest liar on the planet and the biggest actor of them all
i know every one of your tricks
i studied you 30 minutes every single day
Drake shut the fuck up
The Devils Will of Music
For Power
Pegan GODS
Halloween
Octobers Very Own
OVO
