@dalton-adkins-2: Omg, I praise you for this!!!
ugh people who do those stupid chain mail things are so annoying.um just because i don't share a stupid message doesn't mean that i'll have bad luck! and really? my crush's name will appear on the screen in big letters? do you realize how ridiculous that sounds? yeah you can  keep on posting these stupid things but your crush/love of your life won't notice you until you do something. and i'll gladly take the bad luck. know why? because it's not real, and i'm not going to get bad luck. i don't need these things to make a move on my crush, and i doubt a  lot of people do either,so stop sharing these chain mail posts, because not only are they inconvenient to look at, but i'm pretty sure a whole lot of people are annoyed by superstitious nonsensical things like this. i'm sorry for ranting but i''m just tired of seeing that same message everywhere i go. i do love this song though, such a great message in the lyrics!
you are the best love this song
chum Ra ski
We are the crowd
