THIS IS SO FREAKY. 1. say your name 10 times 2. say your mom's name 5 times 3. say your crushes name 3 times 4. paste this to 4 other songs. if you do this, your crush will kiss you on the nearest Friday. but if you read this and do not paste this, then you will have very bad luck. SEND THIS TO 5 SONGS IN 143 MINUTES. WHEN YOU'RE DONE PRESS F6 AND YOUR CRUSH'S NAME WILL APPEAR IN BIG LETTERS ON THE SCREEN. THIS IS SO FREAKY BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY WORK.

For those desperate people out there trying to make money online, go to *www.Givendaily.com* . This site just opened a window of opportunity for me, I’ve been out of work for the past 3 weeks now and it is really hard to find time to work outside when your availability is based on your kid’s school days. I can't afford to pay child care so i thought, why not make money staying at home? I can do both jobs now! Being a mom, wife and earning at the same time! More power!

I buy almost everything except food and clothing from online auctions most people aren’t aware of the almost I unbelievable deals that they can get from online auction sites the site that has the best deals is ...........>>> www.amazon143.com............ I checked with the BBB and was told that it is all legit. How they can sell gift cards, laptops, cameras, and all kinds of goodies that we all want for 50-90% off, I don’t know I do know that I bought my son an ipad there for less than $100 and my husband a $250 Loews gift cards for $48. Why would I even think about shopping anyþlace else ? ............................................................................................................................................................

is this the real one?
