My favorite song of 2017
I KNEW YOU WHEN YOU I WAS YOUNG
LOVE THIS SONG-TAKES ME BACK MAKES ME WISH
@elijah-ahmadi: Your music is shit and you don't have a talent. Use this as your motivation to improve cause as I and everyone else in the world you are a kid with no talents... but what out does talent is work ethic so make it your fucking mission to prove me wrong. Don't become a defensive little bitch backing up shitty music. by the way Carl isn't helping anything except giving you a reason to not improve
@user-35989973: yeah i do that then let it play
@elijah-ahmadi: thats what i used to do but just for fun.
@user-806310665: u don't even know what a real song is
@user-35989973: u know i just use garage band all i do is get on garage band and go to ringtone then drag loops then boom! u have ur song
@user-35989973: no prob
@elijah-ahmadi: sorry but i dont have much experience in making music and stuff
@user-35989973: thanks man that means a lot. you are right 100 %  any tips on my next songs? anything will help
Playing this on repeat until I hate music
@aricwolf: no. don't go out promoting yourself. this is why soundcloud gets made fun of
@elijah-ahmadi: stick to one comment
@elijah-ahmadi: be patient. people want to be looking at what people have to say about this great song. not what these desperate idiots have to say.
@elijah-ahmadi: No
