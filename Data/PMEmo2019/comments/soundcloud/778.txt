Kyleigh Brisendine at 1:16: Dont read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible friday. Tomorrow will bw the best day of your life. Now you’ve started reading this dont stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letter on the screen this is so freaky so it actually works.
