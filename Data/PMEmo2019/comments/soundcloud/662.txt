It was great at the very start, hands on each other. Couldn't stand to be far apart, closer the better. Now were picking fights, and slamming doors magnifying all our flaws. And i wonder why, wonder what for, why we keep coming back for more. Oh oh. Is it just our bodies, are we both losing our minds? is the only reason you're holding me tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely? Do we need somebody, just to feel like we're alright? is the only reason you're holding me tonight cause' we're scared to be lonely?
LOVE THIS VOCAL
wow
You two get married early.
Lovely Storytelling!
