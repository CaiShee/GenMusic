I miss you Prince!
Prince is the baddest artist on the planet
rip prince we miss you
You are so rude. Prince is a legend in music. He is most likely before your time as well as he is for me, but to trash talk and icon's song is disrespectful. I thankfully get to celebrate this man through the power of dance infront of about 100 people. Get some respect for the people who came before you. Please and thank you.
I love probe
this is my favorite  song
I miss you, love
I can't believe I'm just realizing it, but is this song talking about the world ending? A lot of people did think the world was gonna end in 2000. It would only make sense that they're partying so hard in 1999.
god i miss him
love this song and prince
