@dj-anderson1: and you're the ugliest piece of shit I've seen in a while. I'd recommend getting some work done. your peers would appreciate it
@dj-anderson1: jesus christ get a new comeback you must have autism. honestly bro i seriously think you dont have anything beyong a 9th grade education. "cream of sum yung guy" good one only said it like 20 times hahaha. you're pathetic. and you're a garbage dj. just quit and kys
@ramseythaplugg: Cream of sum yum guy, You're obviously gay!

this song is so good!!
Very, Very nice man.  Awesome
makes me think of my Dad. Thank you Cole for this amazing song
@willo02: It is our job because he's COMMERCIALIZING it. Trying to sell it to us. If it's sacred, it shouldn't be commercialized, promoted, exploited. Like I said, probably a nice guy, but many of us "consumers" are sick and tired of hearing the exact same song with interchanged lyrics.
@dj-anderson1: good one. if I had the IQ of a 13 year old, I would laugh too.
great song
@ramseythaplugg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9B-6kSoy6I
@ramseythaplugg: Cream of sum yum guy, You're obviously gay!
@dj-anderson1: you look like a meth head bro you're like 60 im surprised you know how to use a computer. foh corny ass clown i dont fuck with crackheads
I got your back Cole. I dont take that kind of thing to kind. I take it to heart.
Listen people this song is for Cole's dead father, not for you to judge him about his music. Cole doesn't give two shits about your opinion on what you think about his music. YOUR NOT GOD ITS NOT YOUR JOB TO JUDGE PEOPLE, SO STOP.
@user860983110: The is a great song. do you even know the message through this song? Most likely not.
@anthonythegarcon: Really dude. That pisses me off because this is about his dad that passed away. If you didnt like you could've went on about your instead you want to be a asshole and post something like that. get some respect
same sad shit,different country song. Beer, women,trucks.
Good job Cole. Great hook line. This will really connect with people. Made me cry first time I heard it. Ignore the critics.
@rooftopgarden: Amen
THIS IS POP MUSIC THIS ISN'T COUNTRY.
This not good. This NOT country music. This is the kind of stuff studio players HATE doing but have to make a paycheck. Commercial garbage. Sorry Cole, probably a nice guy but this sounds like every other commercial country POS. Go listen to Sturgill Simpson and start over.
BORINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
love this song
I wish I could get this stuff out of my soundcloud feed
Beautiful song.
JK, although, I wish, and whomever this was written for, I hope they are there by now.
