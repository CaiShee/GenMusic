This part right here had me. It''s one of those lip biting moments it's so sexy. One of the HUGEST nods to MJ, as this is really a signature pattern. Dude was a genius and for you to recognize that and commemorate it in such a way is incredible. One of his best little riffs, period. Thank you for including it here.
