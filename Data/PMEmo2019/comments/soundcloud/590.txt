But if you read this and ignore it than you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When done press space and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works. Posted 14 days ago14 days ago  Posted 4 days ago4 days ago

UNRELEASED UZI X CARTI ON MY PAGE!!!
chills. 
super üî• call the fire fighters
Bet, check out Akuma x tenshi page for a spam
This will always fye
This song is honestly lowkey a masterpiece. Uzi chose a really nice orginial catchy beat (not like 69 repetitive beats) and rapped a catchy hook and didnt only rapped but changed his style so 2 differnt type of people will most likely buy the song because its two different styles, my point is this was going to be a hit no matter what!!üíØüíØüíØ
yyyyyyyeeeeeessss

Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 minutes. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works.

Wow and that is coming from a guy named "Rich White Man". Like really you look like all you do is eat kale in a bowl and suck guys off for a living. At least Lil Uzi has some talent and talks about real shit instead of flexing on everyone like all the other rappers.
Saaame
Okay then if you think so then why are you listening to this?

Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually work Posted 5 months ago5 months ago Reply

Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest Friday by the love your life. Now you've started to read this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works

I buy almost everything except food and clothing from online auctions most people aren‚Äôt aware of the almost I unbelievable deals that they can get from online auction sites the site that has the best deals is >>‚ñ∫ www.procartusa.com I checked with the BBB and was told that it is all legit. How they can sell gift cards, laptops, cameras, and all kinds of goodies that we all want for 50-90% off, I don‚Äôt know I do know that I bought my son an ipad there for less than $100 and my husband a $250 Low gift cards for $48.

Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works Posted 27 days ago27 days
