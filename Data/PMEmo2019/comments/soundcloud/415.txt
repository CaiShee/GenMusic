Female brains do mature faster than male brains. This message isn't so shocking, especially since the recent popularization of 'daddy' culture.
this sounds like Melanie martinez
This came on then radio one time and i thought the person announcing it said "guys want aids."
this is awesome

Yass for sugaaaa daddies
So, how old is she?
gay
KICK ASS SONG!
Its a good song, but nevertheless, why couldn't she pick lyrics that don't encourage pedophilia...It may have not meant to be written as such, but music is subjective not objective. Therefore, many people will have many different interpretations of the song.
love this song😍😍
