Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Now that you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore then you'll have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press the space Bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen it actually works
