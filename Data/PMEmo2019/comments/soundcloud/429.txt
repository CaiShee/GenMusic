From College to his hometown was a long windy road with forrest trees on both sides. It was December and we're driving through this road, its night time and pouring rain. Only darkness and headlights surround us. Only some months later, he developed severe mental illness and I was forced to leave him because it got to the point where I couldn't bear it and became massively depressed. I can never listen to this without developing a knot in my throat
