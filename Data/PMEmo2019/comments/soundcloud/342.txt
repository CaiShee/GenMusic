I'll Never Be Like You Flume! Amazing Producer!
2018 and its still a good song
I heard this song before playing Forza Horizon 3, so when I heard it on Future Classic, I was shocked. How do I know Flume? Forza Horizon 2 baby 😜 Hyperparadise
This is a Master Piece... I produce Riddim but I vibe with this soooooo hard. AND I LOVE FORZA HORIZON.

I buy almost everything except food and clothing from online auctions most people aren’t aware of the almost I unbelievable deals that they can get from online auction sites the site that has the best deals is >>>  www.saveslam.com I checked with the BBB and was told that it is all legit. How they can sell gift cards, laptops, cameras, and all kinds of goodies that we all want for 50-90% off, I don’t know I do know that I bought my son an ipad there for less than $100 and my husband a $250 Loews gift cards for $48. Why would I even think about shopping anyþlace else ?

[Verse 2 – Wiz Khalifa]
Don’t even trip
Ain’t really gotta use a scale, I could eyeball a zip
So much weight you thinking, “Why this ain’t for sale?”
Weed in my lungs, weed in my nails
She coning joints, I’m rolling weed up myself
Don’t ever get my weed from off the shelf or my clothes
I heard Polillo ’bout to drop some shit, order those
Pounds, I got more of those, why my eyes sorta low
Not too many when I roll, more arms than (?) though
Boys hating, I’m just counting up the money I just made

Every single instrument used in this song makes the details in this song so amazing. Awesome song
I swear I've listened to this a dozen times. The beat and tiny details in the background of the song is simply beautiful, and the chorus may have taken me by surprise the first time, but it fits the song so well! The lyrics are relateable and the singer herself is amazing. Please, keep up the wonderful work!

Flume cannot be held down, his tracks are fresh and diverse. "Never Be Like You" is a perfect example with a change in pace from his last killer "Some Minds". Of course he never steps wrong pairing up with Kai providing fantastic vocals. Keep going Flume and give us more of what your best at.

New Flume music – three words that should get your attention. And with good reason too because this track is not what we’ve already heard from him before. He’s taken a slightly different direction, with the R&B vocals. But it’s Flume’s touch that takes this track from being completely Pop, to something a little bit more. It’s a gorgeous song, with some real heartbreaking lyrics. Flume’s off to a good start with his upcoming new album! #punkflop #trackdrops #flume #kai http://trackdrops.com/2016/01/23/flume-never-be-like-you-feat-kai/
thats very nice
😍
heart melting <333
u got it baby
hey who made this thumbnail?
@sam-steensen: I know right?! I first heard Flume a few months after his self titled album and was instantly in love. IMO he's trying to be too experimental and "revolutionary" for his own good. I really hope he makes it back to his roots... But at this rate, and as his releases over the past year or so have shown us... Sadly, I don't think he will....
cool sound :D
Flume is getting more and more mainstream
holy shoot... rip my heart, this is so beautiful. I am so in love!
cool
love that he keeps experimenting

I want mygirl to be like me dammit
good gosh this is so amazing
flume has blown my mind again
@0hboy: yeah i'm with you guys. not a fan of this disposable edm/pop sound. not as original and organic as flumes previous work; which I absolutely love, and reminds me of walking to high school because thats all I listened to for the better half of 2012 hahaha.
@ishtolin: it's verging on disposable edm pop.
@ishtolin: agreed. it doesn't sound like flume. not that unique amateur organic sound that caught me in 2012
@official_nyx: disposable EDM pop. no one is going to listen to this a year or two form now... Flume's other 2012 release is another story. That album will be listened to year and years from now. It's original and is a incredible mix of unique, amateur, and organic. It's flume.
@official_nyx: This isn't flume.
This is what the world needs right now
