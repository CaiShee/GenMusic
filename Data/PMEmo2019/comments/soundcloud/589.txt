Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now that you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it than you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When done press space and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works. Posted 14 days ago14 days ago  Posted 4 days ago4 days ago

@jacob-oliver-88329393: same
@malachi-russell-214086857 Gru is the most powerful being in the universe.
Now before any of you report me for shitposting hear me out. First according to the height of a Minion (which is 3.5 feet on average) Gru is 4 minions tall, which means he is a godly size of 14 feet tall. Second if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you Know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking misses at Gru, he then dodge them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. Plus after this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That’s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case.
Howard must be proud
Howard is proud
@user-778260798 yes, he is coming for us all
She on dat powder

Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 minutes. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works. Posted 1 hour ago1 hour Reply Posted 3 months ago3 months ago

[Verse 2 – Wiz Khalifa]
Don’t even trip
Ain’t really gotta use a scale, I could eyeball a zip
So much weight you thinking, “Why this ain’t for sale?”
Weed in my lungs, weed in my nails
She coning joints, I’m rolling weed up myself
Don’t ever get my weed from off the shelf or my clothes
I heard Polillo ’bout to drop some shit, order those
Pounds, I got more of those, why my eyes sorta low
Not too many when I roll, more arms than (?) though
Boys hating, I’m just counting up the money I just made
And what I’m making make a n!gga make a million dollars later
Smoking (?), getting high pays
I like my eyes glazed
Ain’t empty out my ashtray in days
At my house playing pool with some Huf socks and Joyrich sweats
I roll a joint, you roll another one next
Can’t even name a n!gga colder than
Ain’t pay for game that mean you stole it then
Know it’s the bomb when you hold it in

[Hook – Wiz Khalifa]
My weed man got the hookup
Rolling up another pound e’rry time you look up
Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now I’m doing kush ups
Kush ups, ’bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups, ’bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing


so good

Just dropped in to say, Im old and salty, and new music these days sucks. You kids and your otto-toon, and whatever. Rap was way better in the 50's, good ol fashion hippity hoppity rap had real messages like, "Jack and jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water..." That is fire! You don;t hear that kind of skill these days. Chief Keith would probably say "Jack and bitch Jill went to Hill Side projects, to fetch some pills and kill some ops..." check out this new young punk here >>@woofi-1

@user-540795236: Wallace: My total earnings for first month was very low... Just little over $250, but it was then when I realized this is the real deal and not yet another scam you see all over the internet! There are no words to describe the feeling you get when your first paycheck arrives and what excitement I felt at that moment realizing that making money from home is in fact very possible. After my first month I dedicated more time and put more effort in working this and my second month was already much more better (2nd paycheck I got was for $990)... Now, 6 months later, I am earning just over $2500 a month . I am a little slow with my work and I am not that good with computers and that's why I think a younger person could be able to earn much much more than this... ============ http://www.ReportMax90.Com
