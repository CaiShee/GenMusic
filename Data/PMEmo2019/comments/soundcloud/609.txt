@sebastian-alakrah-415446744: I wish it work that way bout it doesn't "sad face"
I wish my family understand me and who I am. They took things away from me that are important to me and I wish I can get them back. What if this happen to you what would you do? Help me understand why?
this song describes me be yourself don't let stuff ruin your life.

This makes me feel like suicide is bot the answer , bc do what u enjoy in life , forget about the bad things , think about all the good things , like yr favourite place and visit it , and then you will appreciate LIFE , like i did 
R.i.p to all rappers , and mostly to everyone who can relate to  this  song , ASK FOR HELP , its out there. 
Gotcha 
who else feels like they wanna cry in this 💯 🔥 song? 
@julian-godinez-apodaca 
everyone should just stop being mean to people who are gay and leave them alone.
I thought about the exact same thing that this songs about.
this song make me cry sometimes
emotional
@exclusivemarzjon-gamer 
But what if i do :( Im thinkin about it guys help!!
@parker-t-846513105  NANI
I felt like this for a while until I found a friend who really cared about me so I know how it feels to want to die it’s a very serious problem in the us so find someone who really cares and you’ll have a very good life

Suicide shouldnt be a thing because teens commit sucide everyday and that cant be normal and its if keep on no one will be here
so true suicide is not the answer to your problems.... forgive and forget.... live is to precious...

@user-382711569 people do care trust me. You may not see it, but someone does care. There is atleast one friend even if you guys arent close that would cry so hard if you were to die. If you still have your mom, she gave birth to you. Think of how depressedd you would be if the kid you gave birth to was lying on the ground unconcius. It ok, you will get through this

na u a gay ass nigga

logic the best
I can relate 
@seligullplays im really sorry to hear about that. Im glad you are getting help with meds, and i hope its working. And im sorry that some people dont understand that this is a real issue. Dont worry, you will get through this. If you still struggle with self harm do this. You can find someone to talk to about it that you feel comfortable having this conversation with. Also, you could distract yourself by doing something you love. If you ever still have really depressive times in your life, just remember if you die now, you cant fall in love. You cant see the ones you love again. Just keep holding on, and doing what makes you happy
Pp
love it very meaningful everybody should listen to the song
i love this song
mineeee
This song makes me think of all of the hurt and pain that I have been through. But it makes me smile because it reminds me that everything I been through only made me strong in the end

@fosty-boy it’s not like we have a choice.
wut?
who said to ome suck their d?
@fosty-boy why does age matter? and how do you know they’re faking it? i’m apart of the younger audience but it doesn’t mean i’m any less hurt. i’ve been abused my entire life, both physically and verbally. do you know how much it must hurt for the younger people?
@fosty-boy i’ve been actually diagnosed with depression, i self harm and i’m currently on meds. yes, there was stupid kids out there but you know this is a real problem right?
@slap-train2: that's so sad tho
nigger
@fosty-boy YASSSSAAS I KNOW ITS SO ANNOYING💀💀😂
lmao all these pre-teens in here like "waaa im so depressed my life is so hard" i cant even 💀💀
I just love this song so much like it's to the point where i just can't even literally been listening to this song for about the past week maybe even longer. I'm never this hooked on a song nut this song I guess their just something different about
@mixx-complex of course. I was hoping it would help someone. Im glad to know my words managed to make someone feel a bit better
@noah-cervantes-424420620 Im really sorry you feel this way😔. I also have my own depressive episodes, and know how it can feel to be depressed. But, i have no clue how you personally feel. Just keep on going. Sometimes, the darkest times in your life help you discover things that make you the most happy. For example, when i was in my darkest place, i used music as my escape and soon found out that its my passion. Even in the worst times, good can still come out of it. My advice to you is find the thing you love to do. If you love writing, write. If you love sports, play them. Just find something that can take you away from your feelings in the moment. Also, if you die now, you cant experience love. If your in love, you cant see the one you love again. You could never get better at your passion, and put that talent into good use. Its ok, you got this. Soon, things will begin to turn around. Just keep pushing through this

hi im sam
@emoji_lover-5022 Im sorry you feel this way. Just keep on going, you can get through this. I too have felt what it feels like to want to kill myself. However, i have no clue how you feel. Everthing will be ok. Just know that if you were to end your life now, you would miss some of the greatest oppurtunities the world has to offer. You could fall in love. You could get better at your favorite hobby that makes you feel so happy when you partake it. Just remember to block out those negative thoughts. There is someone out there who cares so deeply about you, and would feel just as depressed as you are now if you were to leave this earth. Keep holding on, it gets better, you can do this
@slap-train2 wow...Im sosorry that happened to you. I cant imagine the pain  you are in right now. Everything will end up ok. This will hurt for a while, but time will pass, and you can laugh thinking about the fun memories you and your friend had. I hope you are coping with this ok, and things will get better. Just keep holding on. Youll get through this
i love this song
Don't die you have a family that cares about you deeply.
Kinda in the same shoes but not for the same reason

man my bestfriend passed away a cople days ago i have been listing to this song for 2 days shit so sad
Only reason im still alive 💔
love me and you
i feel u bruh
this music touch my heart this music is more then perfect 
@aniela-white i heard this great quote yesterday on a video about suicide. It said, you can die anytime but why rush? Just think about it, if you die, you wont be given a chance to fall in love. You wont be able to do what makes you happy anymore. I also know how it feels to want to die, however i dont know what you are feeling. I wish you the best of luck, you will get through this. The only advice i can give  is find someone you can talk to that you feel comfortable talking about this stuff with. Trust me, there is someone out there who cares about you
Mood
SAD!!!!!!!!!!!! people  really get bullied then next thing you know acully your best friend  is DEAD  THEN YOU GET BULLIED then you dead then rotasion goes on this song is really ture also go wacth 13 REASONS WHY see how IT  feels to be bullied she cut her rised

I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don’t even matter
I know it, I know it, I know I'm hurting deep down but can’t show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home
Ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive)
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today (hey)
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive)
I finally wanna be alive (oh)
I don't wanna die (no, I don't wanna die)
I don't wanna die
(I just wanna live)
(I just wanna live)
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna
I don’t even wanna die anymore
why do you hate your life

@user-6001992 wtf man 
@User 862312374 Logic said it himself in the "Genius"-Interview: He wanted to make a song with the intention to save people's lifes. So many of his fans said him, that he saved their life, but it wasn't his intention. So he decided to make a song WITH the intention to save people's lifes.  Watch the interview, before you spread untrue things.  
@User 862312374 didn't you listen to the lyrics? It's a suicide prevention song. 
@katsumo10  o disagree

Fuck censorship. I'm glad there's a version on Soundcloud with cursing. anyways fucking masterpiece of a song
Check out Sex and Candy by DeJuan "N" Only!! https://soundcloud.com/dejuan_n_only/sex-and-candy
Glad the message has spread so big, but hard to enjoy this knowing Logics manager took the concept from Joyner Lucas
@grace-williams-960884499: :(
@insomniac1006: I am sorry for adding to the fire, have a great day
@user-831009363-744405415: i apologize, this is supposed to be a place to share music and ideas and grow, not to argue.
@insomniac1006: what do you have against the gays
@insomniac1006: i wasnt saying talking doesn't help, i was just saying its hard for some people to say things and that causes more anxiety, thats all
@user-831009363-744405415: look im sorry i assumed. i apologize for calling names. internet fighting is stupid and i shouldn't have said anything... let's just go our separate ways.
@insomniac1006: a pleb like me has a lower conciousness than anybody else here coming from an active "LGBTQAI++ community member" sounds kind of off, I thought you were scolding me about being insensetive, you are a hypoocrite
@insomniac1006: I was in fact, I was saved from a noose failure, I didnt tie it properly, I suggest YOU think before you speak before you assume something so loosely. Also I am completely correct, I have an amazing therapist who helped me get out of a very bad state of depression, and yes, I have real diagnosed depression. If you have a mental illness, try and cope with it and you may find yourself truly content.
@thalia-dewitt-mendoza: i want you to be alive
@user-831009363-744405415: there is so much meaning that a pleb like you can't understand because you are on a lower level of conciousness than everyone hear who has been supportive, and last i checked i don't think ive ever heard another suicide prevention song. The video is gay, but thats what makes it powerful. im part of the LGBTQAI++ community and insensitivity is one of the biggest dick mooves
@user-831009363-744405415: i personally have never been suicidal but so many of my friends have gone through that struggle. you can't say its that easy just to talk to people. problems and anxiety and fear permeate through the minds of so many people and they can hinder someone from speaking up about their problems and the problems keep being dwelt upon until you just can't take it anymore. i hope you learned something from this lesson in empathy and ethics which you obviosly neede. i hope youll think before you speak next time
@user-831009363-744405415: its not that easy. you obviously haven;t been through any of this because this comment of insensitivity shows that
i feel like killing myself
my heart is broken
song is shit

we all have rough times but believe it or not life is worth living you may just not have found it yet.
Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works!!

For everyone who keeps commenting about doing suicide I’m gonna tell you right now you do matter there is help I know that’s what everyone says but there truly not no joke and for the people who are being like complete jerks you need to stop it’s rude it’s nothing to be joking about and quite frankly it’s annoying for all rude ppl who keep doing this is flat out wrong if you have a problem HMU we will talk instead of making fun of people
@lucy-clark-506773927: bruh why u triggered, he is right,there is not much real meaning, its just hella catchy.
everyone is like "i am suicidal". there is a difference between sad and suicidal, so stop. stop sayin your suicidal because if you really where you would be talking to a doctor of a family member.
@harry-acton-725409608: I’m sorry to tell it does it is it’s Anthem for suicide prevention and 18002738255 is the number for the suicide prevention so thank you 🙄😡

@berry-hyena: but I can genuinely tell you that life, though with science/technology we feel we know so much these days, though we are life, ironically so it is so mysterious to us, there is still so much we simply can't put on paper as a theorem. have u always felt this way?
@berry-hyena: that's great you're doing better, I can honestly relate to how you feel about life etc.
@user-65023789: if you need someone to talk to im here for you
@adorable-mutie: hey you wanna talk? we haven't met or anything irl but I care about what you're going through, have u told a parent or teacher about your situation?
@styles-tomlinson1994: and I promise you the world is like a machine and you are a gear that keeps all the other ones going. you are such an important gear, you have a specific reason you're here and you're part of the machine that is meant to do extraordinary stuff I know it, you can ask me how
@styles-tomlinson1994: hey Emilio, we've never met but what you said really struck a chord with me. Please even if you have already tell someone u trust about all you're going through, it doesn't have to be a parent, it could be a teacher or anyone else you trust. but if you wanna talk Im here for you
@star-ramirez-781032038: for real? please tell someone u trust like a parent or teacher what you're going through you will thank yourself after please message me if u wanna to talk

I want you to be alive I want you to be alive You don’t gotta die today You don’t gotta die I want you to be alive I want you to be alive You don’t gotta die Now lemme tell you why  [Verse 2: Alessia Cara] It’s the very first breath When your head’s been drownin’ under water And it’s the light that’s in the air When you’re there chest-to-chest with a lover It’s holding on though the roads long Seeing light in the dark, yeah, these things And when you stare at your reflection Finding hope in who it is I know that you’ll thank God you did

listen to this!
i relate to the first verse
People think its s funny when people commit Suicide but I'm here still fight my life trying not to die. Ive tried commiting suicide multiple times. Im 14 years old in my last year of middle school. I cut cause i have so much pain in my life. I cant stand living but i listen to this song to change my mind. I get bullied in school and i get told to go kill youself die from kids in my school. I told them think next time before you tell a person who is suicidal because that person will end up commiting suicide. I have scars from cutting because im suicidal.
love it
this song is really truly amazing. as most rappers never really rap about stuff like this. I commend Logic with this song. This song has truly helped me with suicidal issues and depression. Thank you for a song that helps people but not kill them.
Love this song
idont?
cool
love this song so much

Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins.

i been underlow i been taken my time
my life aint mine
I’m bi and other people at my school don’t really know besides my three best friends and I’m glad they accept it’s just my siblings are still getting used to and so are my friends this song sheds light on some of my problems it kinda helps me kinda hard to explain but just going to say I support all of you people we are all human and we all feel pain .
i listen to it when im sad or when im just plain bored. sometimes the tune puts a smile on my face but the words are so sad to hear. and the youtube video is sad. why cant people just treat people right. no matter how different they are its sad that people just make fun of eachother just because they are different its so mean and rude!!!!!! and this is why people are suicidal today. because people always say stuff and spread stuff about them. welcome to the world
love this song but its sad :(

The irony.
@user-520969259: My solution to bullies was to entertain them. They bully you out of boredom ya know. Or isolate, I also did that. That really screws with your mind though.
@aibert521: Psshhh you can't even edgelord properly. How do you expect people to kill themselves if you don't even offer an argument on why they should? You're dull. Example: You should kill yourself because you can't even fill the shit stained shoes of a scumbag without being a dumbass about it.

i want to die
GOOD SONG!!!!!!
This makes me cry 😥😥
This Is The Song That Helped My Friend Not Blow His Brains Out

this relates to my friend
love this song
www.soundcloud.com/james_murraymusic
i understand this song fully my uncle killed himself on febuary19,2018 and he was my favorite and it made me soo sad and the meaning of this song is wonderful it was horrible news and i just love
I understand this song. I contacted the suicide hotline because of this song.
This song has been on my play list for the longest time
this is bout my life and its a cool ass song
there's nothing wrong with being gay 
inspiration 
I want everybody to realize that they are not alone. I was bullied and I still am. There will be hardships you have to face in life, but suicide is not the answer. People care about each and every one of you. You are not worthless or pathetic. You are unique and one of a kind. Everyone is.
Good track dude this helped me get through some rough times
@meya-rae: why not?

@aibert521: Dude....
Help me over come my suicide.dont give up.you HAVE something to live for
beast
if my life anit mine id ont to be aliveee
yassss
This song has truly helped me through so much. Around the time that this started getting popular, my life fell apart and I fell into some rough depression. I ended up starving myself and cutting and scratching because I was so done and sick and tired. I didn't really have anybody I could talk to, which made it even worse. It got to the point where I was sitting in the bathroom with a razor blade fighting with myself over whether or not i should slice down my arm and be done. This song was a bit of solace during that time period and I would constantly play it whenever I needed to calm down. Several months later, and look where I am. I'm still on the planet with friends I can talk to, as well as therapy and Zoloft. Today was the first day in a long time where I felt genuinely happy and I could not be more thankful.
@user-692073951: the song's purpose isn't to save people. It's more about promoting awareness, like those "If you or a loved one is considering suicide, please call the hotline" types of things.
dying doesn't end the pain, it passes it on to somebody else
emotinal
This song makes me feel so depressed every time i listen to it. it makes me feel like my life doesn't matter. It also makes me think about other people and how anybody could take their life any day just because of something that someone said or because they listened to this song. To everybody who is reading this your life is worth more than you think.
@caila-george: lit
she needs to leave
I dont want to be alive
I dont want to be alive
I feel like this song is kind of pointless. Even if this song moves someone away from suicide, that really shows how easily they're pushed. They either weren't going to commit suicide in the first place, or they will next week because some sad song pushes them the other way towards suicide. Oh well. I suppose it's also to make the artist look good.

my brother loved this song R.I.P
this song is old but still good
@tyren-hatmaker: gay is okay :P
This song helps me a lot, to anyone who thinks otherwise, screw them. If anyone decides to bully you, whether it be at school or anywhere else, stay strong. It'll be okay in the end.
I can relate
PORN
Who else here wants to die
The Shield
Fuck me
I miss my old friends
I miss 2014
My gf died
My gf dief
Suicide
For all the people that are being depressed and suicidal, don't do it, there is some many things to live for, whether is because of bullying it doesn't matter what they say, because they are hurting aswell, and dont mean anything that they say because your you no matter what they say, whether it's a dead relative, they don;t want you to be with them right away, then want you to still live your life, so go on with life, dont do it.
Groundbreaking much Love Homie!!!

@user-863850483: This song is inspiring i have depression and it gets me through a whole day.
If you think this song isn't 'inspiring'? It's not. I have depression and hearing my songs without depression saying they want to die makes me worse. Not to mention when Logic says 'Who can relate Wooooo' shit, it sounds like depression is a fun thing to have and trendy. Also Logic never had suicidal thoughts so why make this song. If you say for the depressed people, guess what, my friend that cuts and actually wants to kill herself hates this song. This song was released at the wrong moment and Logic should have done a song where's he was discriminated etc

NIGGER
out of my mind i almost committed suicide before
not really that sad
@night-vs-gaming: hi
Cool
@night-vs-gaming: all
@anthony-londono: I understand your pain, I think many people are depressed and not enough people show love and care about individuals. If you really touched by this song please check out my new single "Secluded" in my profile. It would mean tons and hopefully it will touch you too and make you feel better bud.
@night-vs-gaming: there is only one thing that has helped me get through it and it is my girlfriend she is the best girlfriend ever she has helped me through it
@kiara-scharfenberg: EXACTLY. I totally agree with you in that statement. I feel as if the world is always promting negatively and not enough people show love. Most individuals see bullying and hazing but not enough speak up because they scared of being picked on. I am really sorry to hear that Kiara and I hope you can solution to these problems. If this music really touched you, it would mean so much if you can check out my new single "Secluded" on soundcloud. The song is actually in my profile if you click on it, and it touches on so many aspects regarding depression, breakups, and anxiety. Thank you so much and remember you are unique and fucking incredible. :)
everyday it gets harder when i lost me dad because of Ptsd i over heard my mom telling the police the details of how he died and what he looked like now i have that image stuck in my head and it gets harder and harder every day i cant get that image out of my head its hard and when it happened in 2012 i was only 11 but then it was all starting to come to me that he was gone and i wanted the tell him i loved him one last time but i couldn't because he was gone then after that my mom and i were the only ones that went my aunts didn't want anything to do with us after his death it took a year or so but i but i have to grow up with out a dad he was the best dad ever i just wish i could see him one last time and tell him i love him :( :(
@kyreena-gaymon: Hey I also agree, music like this can influence so many people and can change lives. If you love music like this please check out my new single "Secluded" in my bio. I don't mean to come off as every other soundcloud rapper but I promise you will be impressed if you listen to this song.
@nafisa-tarafder: I am very sorry to hear that about your sister and I totally agree with you. Depression is a topic of life that lacks awareness and does not have enough methods to promote prevention of it. Suicide hurts families, friends, communities and that special individual who could have changed the world is now gone. It would mean tons if you could listen to my single "Secluded" in my bio. It addresses the same topic discussed in this song and I was truly inspired from this song to actually write it. Thank you so much :)
@user-419018335: of course man you can survive through everything, that is life. If love this song check out my new single "Secluded" in my bio thanks bro :)

great feel
I do not feel this way, but I will admit the beat and meaning is unique for sure. But the true reason I do not feel the way the song expresses is because God takes such an empty feeling away. It doesn't matter whether you're perfect or not He does not care about any of that. It's all about the relationship you open your heart to, opening your heart to something so much greater than all of us. Giving us the missing love we can't seem to find no matter where we run or what we turn to... It's fulfilling, satisfying to be filled with such an embrance and connection to something that created you and loves you in ways you'll never know or understand unless you take the plunge to find out. Religion is man made, salvation is God given. You can find God if you try hard enough just the same way we try so hard to chase and find other things in life that give us no meaning.
I love this song cause it expresses how a lot of people feel
give me 5 seconds you may like what you hear https://soundcloud.com/mango-kush-138845857/my-own-time

Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works Posted 9 months ago9 months Reply

Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest Friday by the love your life. Now you've started to read this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works
Love it so much i don't wanna die anymore

Don't read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works Posted 1 month ago1 month
its a dope as song
I find it hipocritcal that a song about suicide prevention is restricted. If someone who really was going to kill themselves was to listen, this wouldn't really help.
good music, good rhythm, keep it up bro! rise up! Check me out though!
..
WHO CAN RELATW
Damnthis is solid. i feel it mate

Soundcloud Go. stop this! This can save a life !!!
