Do not read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible friday by the love of your life. Now that youve stated reading this dont stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15. Songs in 144mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will apear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually works!
