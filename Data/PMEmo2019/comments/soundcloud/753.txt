@landon-silva-563268271: They can't do that because certain artists don't want their music re uploaded from other people, like a copyrighted policy.  If they were to do that they could get sued.

Everyone is saying "where's the original I want the original!!!!" You can't upload songs straight that have been made and published by other people, it's called copyright. So please don't come here expecting the original, it says layered in the title.
