🙌🙌🙌 This tune on first radio airplay was the first in probably years to give me the goosbump effect any devoted music lover wishes would happen more often. but thats why i guess its special. but this, was sooo crisp that day, it was like id never heard production quite like. bbc radio1 pristine clarity broadcasting possibly. who knows. what i do know, is that it always sparks a raised eyebrow to see a remix I've not heard yet. sooooo. please kindly keep them coming!! #peace #love #respect #unity ~Nikki. 🙏
