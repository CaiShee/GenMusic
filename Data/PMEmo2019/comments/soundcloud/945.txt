OMG
I'm getting this out of the way now... TRAP NATION DIDN'T FUCKING MAKE THIS. He has contracts that allow him to upload other people's stuff, yeah, but he doesn't make his own shit... Besides, the asshole is a hacker, so why even pay attention to him?
@user-626658794: Seriously? Just because Trap Nation uploaded it doesn't mean he made it.

That drop tho üòª
nicey

dayyum
WAKE UP YOU NEED THE MONEY ! Yeah ...
WAKE UP YOU NEED TO MAKE MONEYYeah
I wish I found some better sounds no one‚Äôs ever heard, I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words, I wish I found some chords in an order that is new, I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,  I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink, But now I‚Äôm insecure and I care what people think. My name‚Äôs ‚ÄòBlurryface‚Äô and I care what you think  Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol‚Äô days, When our momma sang us to sleep but now we‚Äôre stressed out.  Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young, How come I‚Äôm never able to identify where it‚Äôs coming from, I‚Äôd make a candle out of it if I ever found it, Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I‚Äôd probably only sell one,  It‚Äôd be to my brother, ‚Äòcause we have the same nose, Same clothes homegrown a stone‚Äôs throw from a creek we used to roam.
To bad i feel sick or id be singin .... ;-(
OMFG awsome !
