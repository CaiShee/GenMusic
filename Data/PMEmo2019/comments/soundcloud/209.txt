THIS IS SO FREAKY. 1. say your name 10 times 2. say your mom's name 5 times 3. say your crushes names 3 times 4. paste this to 4 other songs. if you do this, your crush will kiss you on the nearest Friday. but if you read this and do not paste this, then you will have very bad luck.

I could very easily hear this on the KMLE playlist (that's Phoenix's biggest FM Country station). Very nice job, especially with the background vocals!
Nicely done, beats, young country!!
You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now you've started reading this don't stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore it then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually worksP
I love you!!!!!!
