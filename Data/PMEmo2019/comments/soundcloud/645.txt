aye doe this came out the same day as my EP haha congrats marc this shits awesome, been following since 2am club
@pix3lpotato: well, to be honest, it is not as bad as most other pop music. it's actually pretty well made.
that moment when the music on the ad is better than the song itself...
you and me
this is the type of song if you're chilling and talking stories with your girl.
I Love  TheTrack: Jah
chris nofs likes to get rammed in the ass by big black dick
lacks authenticity... i feel like Marc is so hit or miss
NYCE
it's like a trap version of train
This is really well-produced.
I have this song on reply constantly for the past 3 days
Very nice vocals.
