I freaking love this song
I GOT YOUOOUOUOUOOOUOUOUOUOU
I love you
I really appreciate the love, you make me feel whole and I have my own loves waiting for me, and they would love if I gave them some attention,
talking about this that and the other, we all have what we want, or need whatever, I would love no more than to make my shit happen
and after that one, I will stay on them until I can get a response or understand how that goes on,at least for them and we can move on to the next place, I still have my worries in the studio but I need to put my new fresh face on with excuses and in real life the devil and demons trying to bring me down and I got to do what it is I think I got to do, and I enjoy living in la la land, and i love the opportunity, I would lov enothing more than to make my dreams come true, no lie
Wednesday will be the first day and I dont expect a respons, i oight to go a bit later, like noon, but the goal is to get me moving to put in that foot work and transit to do what it is I think I need to do to be sucessful
I would like to thank you Ms. Rexh for the love and encouragement that I might 'desperately" need. Come to find out, im still not over my fears of recording in the studio and we are already moving on to performing
I wonder if Mellisa dyed her hair, and im very serious, and even though im very non chalant the songs will get done when they get done. im more anxious about finding gigs, and wednesday is day number one and youu got to start from somewhere
I admit, this is a long process,  very long process, im taking my time and hurrying as fast as I can
Wait is this just a blatant copy of those other songs i've heard???

hi
@passerbye: i drive a porsche cayenne, blacked out kid....something you'll never be able to afford out of your "band van"
@passerbye: i defended the fact of you claiming shes using autotune on all her shit - this, however, is touching tho, making my friday knowing how mad you are BRUH lol
@passerbye: sad that i trolled "almost every song" when i commented on 5 because your music is trash....im a engineer not a musician....you aren't even CLOSE to a musician, i named 3 great artist...."good shows" i make what you make in a year in a month -- so theres "doing nothing for you" LOLOL #fakemusician #wannabe #sorrynotsorry #trolling you is hilarious because you have no comeback as to why you have such few followers...playing in a city of 7 million, when only 30 people come to your show, now THATS embarrassing hahahahahahhaahahahhahahahahahaha
@user-286805827: you mad bro?
@passerbye: airplay? superbowl? YOU HAVE 8 more followers than me and i dont even put tracks up! LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@passerbye: talentless? i like this one song kid....your page and music is trash....want a real artist? bb king....we can also talk about Nas.....we might even be able to chat about MJ....but you can not "sell out" like you think these popular artists did - the thing is, they just have more talent than you...you cant even get your genre's right....LOL #TRASH
@passerbye: you call your shit "electronic" yet its not, you wanna sit here and criticize me on being not a decent musician and you cant ever comprehend the differences of genre's...good name by the way, because after all, you'll just be a passerbye in this music industry....
@passerbye: excuse me? she may have used it slighty on her chorus...but her vocals are not tainted....you dont know jack about me to tell me what kind of "musician" i am...who the fuck are you "homie"....grow up
pervz
dat boy in da pic looks like neymar da soccer player (NEYMAR DAT WOMAN IS NOT UR LOVE, SHES EVIL)
