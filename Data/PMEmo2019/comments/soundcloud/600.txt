Girl Crush!! - Little Big Town!! - Cover!! By @AliBrustofski (l've Got A Girl Crush!!) by @AliBrustofski
everybody sing along
awsome
sexy
Is anyone else in their felings casue it's not giving out the messgae that the female had a crush on another girl but instead it giving out the message that the female is jealus of the girl or she wants the girl just because she smells or tastes like a different person
THIS IS STUPID REMOVE THIS YOU FUCKING BITCH
It's fine I guess
you're my girl crush ^U^ <3
We are always looking for new talent
