Never listened to Blink-182, but this sounds really nice
Why is this gay shit on my homepage and how do I get it off?
Hate DeLong because Skiba make blinks better
sound generic and boring regurgitated mess.  back to pop punk please
mario ochoa
Sounds overproduced... I miss the old Blink. This is not even close to what they used to sound like
Amazing job guys! This sticks true to the B182 style <3
very good
so good
loved blink 182 since all the small things honestly
Hey great song!!!!
ohmyfuckinggod
Are their any other songs that are good from this band. I just want to know
not a bad song to listen to. could get use to this song playing on my phone time to time.

blink 182 still does stuff? i think theyre a bit too old for this
sound like a worship song
https://soundcloud.com/tyler_hutton/echoes-of-the-future
no thanks
Wow I thought this was one of Blink's best songs in a while, the hate must be from beiber fans and 14 year olds who don't understand the concept of music. Oh well good music isn't for everyone I guess lol. Can't wait to see them live next month!
nah
traditional rock with instruments... yea, time is up. boring as fuck
https://soundcloud.com/bloodyxdollas/4pm-snippet

Don't like it.

The song is pretty catchy but the lyrics are kind of lame. Life is too short to last long?? Really? Also it sounds like 2 marks singing now. It's just not the same without a contrasting voice like Tom's.

blink-182 afffffffffff
Without Tom - this is like the old old days. Waggy shit.
The rough streets of Rancho Cucamonga tempered them into the punk rock killing machines they are.  LOLZ
I hated their "im feeling this" crap, but at least they weren't re-treading the same ground in a weak and ineffectual way. Say what you like. I'm not bothered if you like it. I'm not here to stop you. I'm simply giving my opinion that if a band is going to make a reunion album they should either 1.Stick to what they know or 2.Evolve and progress. This album did neither. It's simply an overly produced and vapid attempt at their early music...too bad they lost their balls somewhere along the way. Don't get your panties in a twist.
No, that's not a fair assessment. I liked Green Day when I was a little kid. Even through the time during dookie and insomniac where everyone called them sell outs I defended them. When Nimrod came out and then warning! and everyone said they were "going soft" i still defended them (american idiot however is a complete embarassment). I've defended NoFX, I've defended bad religion, I've defended MXPX, and I've defended the hell out of Blink from flyswatter/uranus/buddha to cheshire cat and Dude Ranch. I even liked a couple songs off of take off your pants. I've seen them live 4 times (and saw them get booed off the stage at the inland invasion). I don't make broad sweeping statements about the inherent value of a band, and I don't throw the word sellout around freely. I've had 20 years to listen to, assess, and re-listen to their music and my opinion remains concrete. They were a good skate/pop punk band, and then they started to suck (to be continued)
we missed you
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ehhh.. I don't dig it
shit song
rescuing a tiger from a tree
I missed Blink :')
this song should have been in American pie
Damn Blink kill em!

I LOVE IT!!!
huh
@skylineheartbeatmusic: Autotune? have you actually seen the Pro Tools project to know that there's autotune on their Vox chain?? interesting. Sounds like it could be Melodyne to me, but okay lol
@h-lamar-thomas: LOL say what you really mean, man. dont hold back like that, cmon!
@koala-and-the-kholes: holy shit you're mad lol. I guess they should have kept making the music they didnt wanna make anymore just for you huh lol. Kind of like if you have an old hobbie, say playing basketball for example. but then one day you change sports because it doesnt interest you anymore. would someone come up to you & say "man, youve changed. you used to play basketball now you play football? the fuck man" makes sense lol
"Life is too short to last long "
I must admit i like it.
This part is siiick. Never thought it would feel so good to have Blink back in the mix.

I wonder if Matt Skiba is still calling all skeletons.
and here we see teenagers that just turned 40.
this makes my happy tbh
@icholasbersole: welcome back old friends
yes
I bought the album a few days ago and have listened to it a dozen times. I think the songs would be so much better without the massive autotune coverup going on.
titties
Wow
Meh.
fuck yeahhhh
this is exactly where they left off no one should be bitching! they stayed so true to their song <3333
love u baby now u got to be getting put on my level ready for if orrrrrrrrr should take nap
I stopped liking them when they did Enema of the State....then they venture into pseudo emo shit for a while now they come back and mix the two bad parts of their career together and come up with this pile of crap. Thanks blink...im glad i wasted time defending you the last decade.
Their new album is actually pretty good surprisingly
lol
Is Matt Skiba writing the songs now??
Check out my page!
Blink 182 my boys!
LOL at this is what Blink-182 sounds like now
wow!!!!!
i love it
pro mix! congrats!
I don't really like their new album. I listened to Enema of the State a lot in my early teens, I'll always love that album. I don't really get why everyone is saying it sound like your old stuff, but I haven't listened to anything recent.
love the drums !.. its been too long
i miss those drums so much!!!
stop making music 
Wow sounds like their old stuff! TERRIBLE!

NO!!! I did not lnk this. I have not played this. Blink 182 or anything like them does not appear anywhere in my music or writings. This is SPAM! Stop it, SoundCloud, you are not the only service in town. Please remove from my playlist. I will not play it. I will not do anything as there is NO as in ZERO options to delete or remove. Please remove. Give me your home emails please, so I can load you up with spam, SC devs and mods. I would appreciate also if you would give me your personal SC account so that I can load it up with Milli Vanilli or some awful crap. Leave me alone
Right On!
It's what they left off with. Enema of the State. Revisit that album please?
were the FUCK have you been all my life??
Love.
takin' it back
cool
@epsilonbeats: This is true, however I think thats why we like them so much, they make us laugh and then cry... Sometime in the same song XD
@user-169647598: hi
@user-798395210: no
@epsilonbeats: their*
@verickknight: haha its good, i know they have like "emotional" songs, but i like they're funny tracks a lot more.
@epsilonbeats: As soon as it started playing I started head banging... Its pretty refreshing hearing new Blink, why didn't you like it at first?
@verickknight: haha i didn't like it at first (compared to the older blink), ...but it grew on me. The drums are tight. 91.1 and blink go way back. hah
@epsilonbeats: that wouldn't be too bad for the first week, on week 3 I'd be pulling my hair out
Tom has to protect us from the aliens. wtf haha this track is tight.
@verickknight: lol San Diego radio is playing this non stop :P
New Blink.... Where have been! It's high school allover again, yessir!
