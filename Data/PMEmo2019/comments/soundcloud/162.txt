Don’t read this. You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life. Tomorrow will be the best day of your life. Now your reading this don’t stop this is so freaky. But if you read this and ignore then you will have very bad luck. Put this on 15 songs in the next 144 mins. When you are done press space bar and your crushes name will appear in big letters on the screen this is so freaky it actually work. Posted 11 months ago11 months ago

PLEASE DON'T READ THIS. YOU WILL BE KISSED ON THE NEAREST POSSIBLE FRIDAY BY THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.TOMORROW WILL BE THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. NOW YOU'VE STARTED READING THIS. DON'T STOP. THIS IS SO FREAKY. 1. say your name 10 times 2. say your mom's name 5 times 3. say your crushes name 3 times 4. paste this to 4 other songs. if you do this, your crush will kiss you on the nearest Friday. but if you read this and do not paste this, then you will have very bad luck.

11. Rockabye don't bother cry Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky, yo (Rockabye!) Rockabye don't bother cry (yeah yeah) Angels around you, just joy your eye (Rockabye!) Rockabye don't bother cry Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky, yo (Rockabye!) Rockabye don't bother cry  Angels around you, just joy your eye
Sorry
10. She tells him "ooh love" No one's ever gonna hurt you, love I'm gonna give you all of my love Nobody matters like you (stay up there, stay up there) She tells him "your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life (straight) You're gonna grow and have a good life I'm gonna do what I've got to do" (yeah)
9. Now she gotta a six year old Trying to keep him warm Trying to keep all the cold When he looks her in the eyes He don't know he's safe when she says
8. Rockabye don't bother cry Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky, yo Rockabye don't bother cry Angels around you, just joy your eye
7. So, rockabye baby, rockabye I'm gonna rock you Rockabye baby, don't you cry Somebody's got you Rockabye baby, rockabye I'm gonna rock you Rockabye baby, don't you cry (Bidda-bang-bang-bang, alright then) Rockabye, no (Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye) (Oh) Rockabye, yeah (Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye) (yeah)
6. "Ooh love" No one's ever gonna hurt you, love I'm gonna give you all of my love Nobody matters like you
5. Now she gotta a six year old Trying to keep him warm Trying to keep all the cold When he looks her in the eyes He don't know he's safe when she says
4. Single mom what you doing out there? Facing the hard life without no fear  Just see and know that you really care 'Cause any obstacle come you well prepared And no mamma you never shed tear 'Cause you haffi set things year after year And you give the youth love beyond compare You find the school fee and the bus fare Hmmmm more when paps disappear In a wrong bar can't find him nowhere Steadily you work flow, heavily you know so you nah stop No time no time fi a jeer
3. So, rockabye baby, rockabye I'm gonna rock you Rockabye baby, don't you cry Somebody's got you Rockabye baby, rockabye I'm gonna rock you Rockabye baby, don't you cry Rockabye, no (Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye) (oh) Rockabye, yeah, yeah (Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye)
2. She tells him "ooh love" No one's ever gonna hurt you, love I'm gonna give you all of my love Nobody matters like you (stay up there, stay up there) She tells him "your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life (straight) You're gonna grow and have a good life I'm gonna do what I've got to do" (stay up there, stay up there)
1. She works the night, by the water She's gonna stress, so far away from her father's daughter She just wants a life for her baby All on her own, no one will come She's got to save him (daily struggle)
