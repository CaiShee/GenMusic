@user-71623442: chain mail. So old and fake
And now your song.... is on repeat-
This song is probrably the best i've ever heared! I hear it everyday for a year now and I still enjoy it. I just try to hear it not to often to get maybe bored of it sometimes! So good job on this. Its perfect how the track glues togheter with all those classical instruments and the pop sound to it! Melody and chords are insane. And i love zara on the vocal too. She got a really special voice to me. idk why but her voice catched me. Its defenetely a musical masterpice. There is nothing I would have changed or I dont like! I dont know another song i like that much like this. Respect to Clean Bandit and Zara Larsson! Especially to Jack Patterson!
SYMPHONY!
