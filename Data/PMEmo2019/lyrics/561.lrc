[00:00.00] 作曲 : Justin Hurwitz
[00:01.00] 作词 : Justin Hurwitz
[00:15.77]I think about that day
[00:17.57]I left him at a Greyhound station
[00:19.56]West of Sante Fe
[00:21.26]We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
[00:24.80]Still I did what I had to do
[00:28.14]'Cuz I just knew
[00:31.00]
[00:30.78]Summer Sunday nights
[00:32.77]We'd sink into our seats
[00:34.03]Right as they dimmed out all the lights
[00:36.12]The Technicolor world made out of music and machine
[00:40.06]It called me to be on that screen
[00:43.74]And  live inside each scene
[00:44.75]
[00:46.34]Without a nickel to my name
[00:47.93]Hopped a bus, here I came
[00:50.02]Could be brave or just insane
[00:51.91]We'll have to see
[00:53.70]'Cuz maybe in that sleepy town
[00:55.65]He'll sit one day, the lights are down
[00:57.39]He'll see my face and think of how he used to know me
[00:59.15]
[01:01.34]Climb the hills I'm reaching for the heights
[01:05.02]And chasing all the lights that shine
[01:08.71]And when they let you down
[01:12.80]You'll get up off the ground
[01:16.48]As morning rolls around
[01:18.88]And it's another day of sun
[01:20.52]
[01:23.03]I hear them everyday
[01:26.11]The rhythms in the canyons that will never fade away
[01:29.55]The ballads  In the barrooms  left by those who came before
[01:33.59]They say "you gotta want it more"
[01:37.03]So I bang on every door
[01:38.27]
[01:39.17]And even when the answer's no
[01:41.32]Or when my money's running low
[01:43.06]The dusty mic and neon glow are all I need
[01:44.80]
[01:46.99]And some day as I sing the song
[01:48.93]A small-town kid will come along
[01:50.74]That'll be the thing to push him on and he'll go
[01:52.48]
[01:54.43]Climb the hills I'm reaching for the heights
[01:58.12]And chasing all the lights that shine
[02:01.91]And when they let you down
[02:05.89]You'll get up off the ground
[02:09.63]As morning rolls around
[02:12.27]And it's another day of sun
[02:13.92]
[02:47.74]When they let you down
[02:51.64]The morning rolls around
[02:53.74]
[02:54.63]It's another day of sun
[02:58.07]It's another day of sun
[03:01.81]It's another day of sun
[03:05.45]It's another day of sun
[03:09.30]Just another day of sun
[03:12.73]It's another day of sun
[03:17.01]The day has just begun
[03:22.43]It's another day of sun
[03:26.91]
[03:41.36]It's another day of sun
